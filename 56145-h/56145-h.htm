<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>To the two former Essays, on ‘The English Village
Community’ and ‘The Tribal System in Wales,’ is now
at last added in this volume a third on ‘Tribal Custom
in Anglo-Saxon Law.’</p>

<p>In the first Essay an attempt was made to approach
the early Anglo-Saxon evidence from the point of view
of the Manorial system, and mainly by tracing back its
connection with the open field system of agriculture&mdash;the
shell, so to speak, in which it had all along apparently
lived.</p>

<p>The object of this third Essay in the trilogy is to
approach the Anglo-Saxon laws from the point of view
of tribal custom.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to this attempt, a detailed study of
Cymric tribal custom was made in the intermediate
Essay in the belief that the knowledge so gained might
be used as a clue to the understanding of survivals of
tribal custom in the laws of the tribes most nearly allied
to the invaders of Britain, and lastly in the Anglo-Saxon
laws themselves.</p>

<p>The interval which has elapsed between the publication
of the three Essays has made it necessary to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
each of them, to some extent, independent and complete
in itself.</p>

<p>It thus becomes necessary in this volume briefly to
repeat, as well as further to develop, what was learned
of Cymric tribal custom in the previous volume, especially
as regards the ‘gwely,’ or family unit of tribal
society, and as regards the methods of payment of the
galanas, or death-fine for homicide in lieu of the blood-feud
between kindreds.</p>

<p>The death-fine or wergeld of the Continental tribes
forms so important a test of the position of classes in
tribal society that it became necessary to ascertain at
the outset what were the currencies in which the wergelds
were stated and paid. A brief explanation of
these will be found in the first chapter.</p>

<p>Then follows the summary of the Cymric evidence.
And as some of the points connected with the payment
of wergelds can only be rightly understood when regarded
from the point of view of the blood-feud for
which the wergeld was a substitute, the Cymric evidence
is followed by a brief examination of the rules of the
feud incidentally revealed in ‘Beowulf.’</p>

<p>A chapter on Irish or Goidelic tribal custom completes
the preliminary evidence.</p>

<p>The inquiry into the tribal custom of the Continental
tribes as revealed in their laws is proceeded with in
the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p>First the Burgundian and Wisigothic laws are briefly
examined, as showing most clearly the disintegration of
tribal custom caused by early contact with Roman and
Christian influences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Next are examined the traces of tribal custom in the
laws of the Salic and Ripuarian Franks and of the tribes
conquered by the Merovingian Kings. Separate consideration
is then given to the laws of the tribes conquered
by Charlemagne.</p>

<p>The earliest Norse and Scanian laws next claim a
full share of attention; for, although much later in date
than the others, they exhibit earlier conditions of tribal
custom.</p>

<p>Lastly, after a short chapter on tribal custom in the
ancient laws of Scotland and the ‘leges inter Brettos et
Scotos,’ attention is turned to the Anglo-Saxon laws, and
they are approached from the tribal point of view and
the vantage-ground afforded by the previous study of
the tribal customs of the Continental tribes.</p>

<p>That by this method of study some fresh light may
have been thrown on the conditions of early Anglo-Saxon
society I think the reader will admit. And
imperfectly as the work has been done, the bringing of
Anglo-Saxon evidence more into line with the Continental
evidence will, I think, be accepted as a permanent
gain.</p>

<p>After all, we are but trying to advance a step
or two further, as regards some particular points,
the general intention of the masterly contributions of
Dr. Konrad von Maurer, made nearly half a century ago
to the <i>Kritische Ueberschau</i>, which I think have hardly
been sufficiently kept in view by English historical
students.</p>

<p>How far the evidence contained in this Essay may
be found on full consideration to modify previous views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of others or my own the reader will be left to judge.
I have tried throughout to bring an open mind to the
inquiry from a fresh point of view, with but little regard
to foregone conclusions. Any new facts elicited will
find their proper place without displacing those already
known, however much they may ultimately modify the
conclusions provisionally drawn from the latter.</p>

<p>The method of inquiry from the known to the unknown
is essentially a tentative method. It necessarily
leads to results which, if isolated, easily mislead and
may be still more easily misapprehended. But correction
comes with perseverance in the same method from
other points of view, whilst in the intermediate stages of
such an inquiry the student has to learn to be content
sometimes with a provisional restatement of a problem
rather than a premature solution.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to pretend that, were it necessary
to rewrite the Essay on ‘The English Village Community’
after an interval of nearly twenty years, modification of
many points might not be needful. But as further editions
were called for, it seemed best to leave it as it was, a
link in a chain of inquiry which has not yet come to an
end. Other links have been added by far more competent
inquirers, and these have generously given it a
place in the chain from which it would indeed be ungrateful
in me to wish to unlink it. But I venture to
hope that the addition of this third Essay will be accepted
not only as a further contribution to the understanding
of a difficult subject, but also as evidence that
kindly criticism of the former volumes has not been
thrown away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>For constant help in the preparation of this volume
I am indebted to my son, whose essay on ‘The Structure
of Greek Tribal Society’ really ought to form one of this
series. My thanks are due to Dr. <span class="smcap">Atkinson</span> and Prof. <span class="smcap">Rhys</span>
for help as regards the Irish and Welsh chapters; and
to Mr. <span class="smcap">Craigie</span> for careful revision of the text and translations
of the passages quoted from the early Norse laws.
To Prof. <span class="smcap">Liebermann</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">W. H. Stevenson</span>, for help
in the reading of some difficult passages in the Kentish
laws, I am especially indebted. I regret very much that
I have not had the help which Prof. <span class="smcap">Liebermann’s</span> notes
to his text of the Anglo-Saxon laws would have been.
To Mr. <span class="smcap">F. G. Hill</span>, of the British Museum, I owe very
much in connection with the study of the currencies
used in the various laws. Finally, I cannot too warmly
express my gratitude especially to Prof. <span class="smcap">Vinogradoff</span>,
Prof. <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>, and Mr. <span class="smcap">W. J. Corbett</span>, amongst others,
for the help and encouragement which only fellow-workers
can give to the otherwise solitary student.</p>

<h3>I. CONNECTION BETWEEN THE WERGELD OF 100 HEAD
OF CATTLE AND THE MINA OF 100 GOLD STATERS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The currencies
in which
wergelds
were paid.</div>

<p>The inquiry pursued in this volume partakes so
much of the character of a study of the wergelds of
the various tribes of North-western Europe that it
becomes necessary as briefly as possible to call
attention at the outset to the currencies in which
they were reckoned and paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cows.</div>

<p>The Cymric galanas or death fine was reckoned
in cows, and the cows were equated with silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Female
slaves.</div>

<p>The Irish ‘eric’ of the Brehon laws was stated in
<i>cumhals</i> or female slaves, and lesser payments in cows
and heifers, and these were all equated with silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Silver.</div>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon wergelds were stated, with perhaps
one exception, in silver scillings.</p>

<p>The wergelds of the Scandinavian tribes were
generally stated in their laws in silver marks, ores,
and ortugs, with the equivalent in gold at a ratio
of 1:8, and also in cows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold
solidi.</div>

<p>Those of the Continental German tribes were
generally stated in gold solidi, but the statements
were sometimes supplemented by clauses describing
the value of the animals, whether oxen or cows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in which the payments were, in practice, still
evidently made, at the date of the laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early
equation
between
cattle and
gold.</div>

<p>Professor Ridgeway<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has shown that the equation
between cattle and gold may go back a long way
into the past of Eastern tradition. The result of
his careful inquiry was the brilliant suggestion that
the ox&mdash;the most usual unit of payment in agricultural
countries&mdash;was very early and very generally
equated in Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Greek
usage with the gold stater or didrachma.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greek
stater the
ox-unit.</div>

<p>The stater was reckoned in Greek usage as of
192 wheat-grains.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was divided into 6 diobols of
32 wheat-grains. And throughout the East the
usual multiples of the stater were the <i>light mina</i> of
50 staters and the <i>heavy mina</i> of 100 staters or
19,200 wheat-grains.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Now if the gold stater of 192 wheat-grains is to
be recognised as the ox-unit in traditional equations
between cattle and gold, another very important
recognition suggests itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Normal
wergelds
of 100
head of
cattle</div>

<p>Wergelds being first paid in cattle, it was
natural that a round number of cattle should be
chosen, and instances are not wanting in the Eastern
world suggesting that ‘a hundred head of cattle’
was a customary normal wergeld of wide prevalence.</p>

<p>Among the Arabs to this day Professor Robertson
Smith states<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that the camel is the unit of payment,
and that, in a feud between two Meccan tribes,
the manslayer has the alternative of paying 100
camels or bringing 50 of his kin to take oath of
purgation, or lastly of abiding the blood-feud.</p>

<p>According to the laws of Manu, if one of the
highest of the twice-born Brahman class slew one of
the Warrior class involuntarily, he might cleanse himself
by paying to the Brahmans or priests 1000 cows
and a bull. If he slew one of the agricultural or
trading class, the payment was 100 cows and a bull.
If he slew one of the servile class, the payment was
10 cows and a bull.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In this case 100 cows seem to have been the
normal wergeld, and the wergelds of those of higher
or lower caste or rank seem to have been multiples
or fractions of it.</p>

<p>In Homer there are indications of the same thing.
Lycaon was sold as a captive for 100 oxen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
redeemed as a chieftain’s son for 300 oxen&mdash;being
apparently valued at a threefold wergeld on account
of his recognised princely rank.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Iliad, XXI. 39. ‘And at that time he sold him into well-peopled
Lemnos, sending him on shipboard, and the son of Jason gave a
price for him and thence a guest-friend freed him with a great
ransom, Eetion of Imbros, and sent him to goodly Arisbe; whence
flying secretly he came to his father’s house (at Troy). Eleven
days he rejoiced among his friends after he was come from Lemnos,
but on the twelfth once more God brought him into the hands of
Achilles again.’</p>

<p>71. ‘Then Lykaon besought him.… At thy table first I
tasted meal of Demeter on the day when thou didst take me
captive in the well-ordered orchard, and didst sell me away from
my father (Priam) and my friends unto goodly Lemnos, and <i>I
fetched thee the price of an hundred oxen</i>. And now I have
been ransomed <i>for thrice that</i>, and this is my twelfth morn since
I came to Ilios after much pain.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
normal
wergeld
equated
with the
gold mina
of 100
staters.</div>

<p>Now if a herd of 100 head of cattle had come to
be a common normal wergeld in the Eastern world,
and if the gold stater had come to be regarded as
the ox-unit, it follows that the heavy gold mina of
100 staters would easily come to be adopted as a
common equivalent for the wergeld of 100 head of
cattle.</p>

<p>Nor are we without examples which show that
this connection of the wergeld with the gold mina
was not altogether foreign to traditional modes of
thought.</p>

<p>In the laws of Gortyn<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a man whose life was
forfeit for crime might be redeemed by his kindred
for 100 staters, <i>i.e.</i> the heavy gold mina.</p>

<p>The ransom of prisoners between certain Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
tribes or states according to Herodotus was two minas,
<i>i.e.</i> one heavy mina.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>There is a curious instance in the Mosaic law of
the connection of something like a wergeld with the
mina of silver. In the last chapter of Leviticus the
price to be paid for the redemption of a man dedicated
by a vow to the service of the Sanctuary was
50 shekels of silver: that is, the light mina of silver.</p>

<h3>II. THE SAME EQUATION REPEATED BETWEEN THE WERGELDS
OF WESTERN TRIBES AND 200 GOLD SOLIDI
OF CONSTANTINE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The gold
solidus of
Constantine
a
half-stater.</div>

<p>Following the same thread of suggestion and
turning from the Eastern to the Western world, we
pass at a leap from the Eastern gold stater of 192
wheat-grains to the gold solidus of Constantine, of
exactly half that number.</p>

<p>Up to the time of Constantine there had been
confusion in the currency of the Roman Empire. It
had been mainly a silver currency. Few gold coins
were in general circulation, and these were of various
standards. But at last the gold solidus of Constantine
placed the world in possession of a fixed gold
standard acknowledged all over Europe and remaining
unchanged till the fall of the Eastern Empire.</p>

<p>The importance of this fact is obvious. For our
knowledge of most of the wergelds of the tribes
conquered by the Merovingian Franks and later on
by Charlemagne is dependent upon it, inasmuch as
the laws in which the customs of these tribes were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
some sense codified, almost always describe the
wergelds in gold solidi.</p>

<p>The gold solidus of Constantine was fixed by him
at 1/72 of the Roman pound or ⅙ of the Roman ounce.</p>

<p>The Roman pound (originally used for copper) was
built up from the scripulum according to the duodecimal
system of the <i>As</i>, thus:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold
tremisses
of 32
wheat-grains.</div>

<p>The solidus of Constantine therefore contained 96
wheat-grains of gold, exactly the same number as the
Eastern drachma, and half that of the stater or
didrachma. At the same time smaller coins&mdash;thirds
of the solidus, called <i>trientes</i> or <i>tremisses</i>&mdash;were issued
in great numbers, and these tremisses contained 32
wheat-grains of gold, exactly the same number as the
Greek <i>diobol</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
normal
wergeld of
200 gold
solidi =
gold mina.</div>

<p>So that, in wheat-grains, the very prevalent statement
of the wergeld of the full freeman in the laws
of various tribes as 200 gold solidi was in fact the
same thing as a statement that the wergeld was a
<i>heavy gold mina</i>, for 200 solidi of 96 wheat-grains
contained exactly the same number of wheat-grains
as did the heavy mina of ancient Eastern usage&mdash;viz.
19,200. In other words, so persistent seems to have
been the traditional connection of the wergeld with
the gold <i>mina</i> that Roman monetary usage was
overruled, and instead of reckoning in Roman drachmas,
ounces, and pounds, the wergelds were reckoned
once more, or perhaps we should say continued to be
reckoned, in what was really the heavy gold <i>mina</i> of
200 solidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">And was
often the
equivalent
of 100
oxen.</div>

<p>Further than this, in the laws of some of the tribes,
as we shall find, the double solidus or stater still
retained its position as the gold equivalent of the ox,
so that the typical wergeld of 200 gold solidi in these
cases was actually, like the <i>mina</i>, the gold equivalent
of 100 oxen.</p>

<p>Even where variations are found from this prevalent
equation we shall still sometimes find the principle
preserved, some other animal being substituted
for the ox, and sometimes the long hundred of 120
being substituted for the decimal hundred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
standard
weight of
the wheat-grain
varied.</div>

<p>If this had been the whole truth the matter would
be simple. But the fact is that, although the wergeld
of 200 solidi of Constantine was the exact equivalent
of the heavy gold mina reckoned in <i>wheat-grains</i>, there
were differences in the standard weight of the wheat-grain.
As already mentioned, the actual weights of
Eastern and Greek staters were not exactly alike,
and the Roman standard, in actual weight, was higher
than the Eastern and Greek standards.</p>

<p>The latest authorities, Hultsch and Lehmann,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
on the evidence of inscribed weights, describe what
may for convenience be called the Eastern gold mina&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the <i>heavy</i> gold mina of Assyrian and Babylonian
metrology&mdash;as weighing 818 grammes, or 100
staters of 8·18 grammes. They tell us also that there
was a <i>commercial</i> mina of 120 of the same staters. This
commercial mina therefore weighed 982 grammes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
metrologists have inferred that the Roman pound was
derived from this commercial mina being in fact
exactly one third of its weight, or 327 grammes.</p>

<p>Now, as the commercial mina contained 120
staters of 8·18 grammes, it is obvious that the
Roman pound, being one third of it, ought to have
been divided, had Eastern reckoning been followed,
not, as Constantine divided it, into 36 staters of 9·08
grammes, but rather into 40 staters of 8·18 grammes.</p>

<p>In other words, had Constantine, instead of following
the Roman system of division, followed the
Eastern system and divided the Roman pound into 40
staters of 8·18 grammes in weight, his double solidus,
whilst containing 192 Eastern wheat-grains, would
have contained only 172·8 Roman wheat-grains. As
a matter of fact the Eastern stater of 8·18 grammes,
if put in the Roman scales of Constantine, would have
weighed only 172·8 wheat-grains of Roman standard,
and the tremisses 28·8 wheat-grains. The Roman
pound would have contained 240 of such tremisses,
and the ounce 20 of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>This is not the place to enter more deeply into
the metrological question, but its interest in this
inquiry lies in the fact that in Western Europe,
in spite of Roman conquests and Roman influence,
and in spite of the general knowledge and prevalence
of the gold solidi and tremisses of the Empire, there
seems to have been a remarkable tendency, consciously
or unconsciously, to revert to the Eastern
standard by dividing the Roman pound into 40 staters,
80 solidi, and 240 tremisses.</p>

<p>The ancient Gallic gold coinage, extending from
the valley of the Danube across Gaul into Britain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was apparently of this ancient Eastern standard. And
Cæsar himself, after his conquest of Gaul, reverted
to it when he issued gold staters of one fortieth of
the Roman pound.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Finally we shall find, in our next
section, the Merovingian Franks, consciously or unconsciously,
doing the same.</p>

<h3>III. THE FRANKISH CURRENCY.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The early
currency
of the
Franks
mostly
gold.</div>

<p>Most of the laws of the Continental tribes seem
to have had their origin in the necessity to commit
into writing what remained of local custom after
Frankish conquest.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking they belong to two periods&mdash;the
earlier one that of the conquests of the Merovingian
Franks, and the later one that of the conquests
of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary, therefore, to distinguish
between the coinage and currency of the two
periods.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>When we turn from the Imperial currency of
gold solidi and tremisses to that of the Frankish
princes, we find them using a peculiar system of
monetary reckoning, founded upon the metrical
system already alluded to, of 20 tremisses or pence
to the ounce and 240 to the pound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At first of
Roman
solidi and
tremisses;
afterwards
of the
smaller
tremisses
of 28·8
wheat-grains;
then of
silver
tremisses
or pence
of the
same
weight.</div>

<p>At first the Merovingian kings seem to have used
or copied the Imperial solidi and tremisses. But
before long they issued an abundant gold currency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of their own, consisting almost entirely of tremisses.
And these tremisses were reduced in weight by the
division of the Roman pound of 6912 wheat-grains
into 240 tremisses of 1/20 of the ounce, <i>i.e.</i> 28·8
instead of 32 wheat-grains. The abundant currency
of these lighter gold tremisses continued till nearly
the close of the Merovingian period. And how
abundant this gold currency was, is shown by the fact
that nearly 10,000 examples are recorded in the
catalogues of Merovingian coins in public and private
collections.</p>

<p>But towards the close of the Merovingian period
came one of those strange monetary changes, so
difficult to account for, which before long put an end
altogether to the issue of these gold tremisses.</p>

<p>All through the Merovingian period payments
had no doubt been made in silver as well as in gold,
by weight, and during the later part of the period
silver tremisses were issued of the same weight as the
gold. And thus gradually, at first concurrently with
the gold tremisses and at last driving them out, came
into use a silver currency of 20 pence to the ounce
and 240 to the Roman pound.</p>

<p>With this silver currency and the following of
this weight system came in apparently the method
of silver monetary reckoning, so familiar to us, of
dividing the pound of 240 pence into 20 solidi or
shillings of 12 pence&mdash;the pound being still the
Roman pound of 6912 wheat-grains. This silver
solidus was, however, only one of account and was
never issued as a coin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>nova
moneta</i> of
Charlemagne.</div>

<p>Finally, just before Charlemagne assumed the title
of Emperor another change was made by the issue of
his <i>nova moneta</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">His pound
of 240
silver
tremisses
of 32
wheat-grains,
and silver
solidus
of account
of 12
pence.</div>

<p>The silver currency had by this time become
predominant, and in the capitularies the silver solidus
of 12 pence had already come into use. Charlemagne,
in issuing the <i>nova moneta</i>, made no alteration in the
method of reckoning, except that he brought the
weight of the silver tremissis or penny back again to
the Imperial standard of 32 wheat-grains, thus making
his pound of 240 of the new pence 7680 wheat-grains
instead of 6912 and the ounce 640 instead of 576.</p>

<p>At the same time we shall find that he tried, by
making his <i>nova moneta</i> legal tender, to force the new
silver solidus of 12 pence into use as equivalent, in
payments, for the gold solidus of three gold tremisses,
which up to that time had been the solidus of the
Salic laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Made legal
tender at
a ratio of
1:4 with
gold.</div>

<p>This involved the altogether impossible ratio of
1:4 between the two metals instead of the Imperial
ratio of 1:12.</p>

<p>In considering the wergelds of the laws belonging
to this period, we shall find plenty of evidence of the
confusion resulting from this remarkable experiment,
made more apparent by the fact that the ratio of
1:12 was restored by one of Charlemagne’s successors.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to trouble the reader with
this brief statement of somewhat complicated facts,
because it would be impossible to understand the
wergelds of the various Continental tribes if they
were not borne in mind.</p>

<p>For the understanding of these wergelds the
points to be considered will be:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) As regards the laws, the recensions of which
date from Merovingian times, it will be necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ask whether the solidi and tremisses were of Imperial
or of Merovingian standard.</p>

<p>(2) As regards the later laws, the recensions of
which date from the conquests of Charlemagne, we
shall have to consider whether the wergelds are
stated in gold solidi and tremisses, or in the silver
solidi and pence of the <i>nova moneta</i> of Charlemagne.</p>

<h3>IV. THE NORMAN AND ANGLO-SAXON CURRENCY.</h3>

<p>Working back from the known to the unknown,
the facts relating to the Norman and Anglo-Saxon
currency, speaking generally, confirm what has
already been said of the Frankish currency, and
become intelligible when the two currencies are
considered together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Norman
and later
Anglo-Saxon
pound
of 240
pence of
32 wheat-grains.</div>

<p>In the first place, the Norman and Anglo-Saxon
pound at the time of the Norman conquest was
the pound of 7680 wheat-grains of silver or 240
silver pence of 32 wheat-grains, like that of the <i>nova
moneta</i> of Charlemagne, and the Normans, like the
Franks, divided it for monetary purposes into 20
shillings of 12 pence.</p>

<p>At the same time the Normans recognised that
the Mercians had all along reckoned in silver scillings
of 4 pence, and the men of Wessex in scillings of
5 pence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
earlier
pound of
240 sceatts
or silver
tremisses
of 28·8
wheat-grains.</div>

<p>If we examine the actual coinage of the Anglo-Saxons
we find that, like that of the Franks, it may
be divided into two periods. The earlier one
corresponded to the Merovingian period during
which the penny or sceatt of Mercia and Wessex was
of 28·8 wheat-grains, like the silver tremisses or pence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
across the Channel.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The later period commenced
when Offa in Mercia, followed by Alfred in Wessex,
abandoned the ‘sceatt’ and issued pence like those
of the <i>nova moneta</i> of Charlemagne of 32 wheat-grains.</p>

<p>So marked is the distinction between the silver
pence of the two periods in type and weight that they
are known by numismatists as the ‘Sceatt series’
and the ‘Penny series.’</p>

<p>Finally, just as, in the case of the Frankish
currency, the pound of 240 sceatts was the Roman
pound of 6912 wheat-grains, so the pound of 240 of
the later pence was the pound of the <i>nova moneta</i> of
7680 wheat-grains, which in England after the
Conquest became the standard or Tower pound.</p>

<p>At the same time it must be remembered that
the identity or difference in these cases is in the
reckoning in wheat-grains, and that there was room
for some variation in the actual weight of the coins.</p>

<h3>V. THE MINAS WHICH SURVIVED IN USE SIDE BY SIDE
WITH THE ROMAN POUND.</h3>

<p>According to the writers of the Merovingian and
later period collected by Hultsch,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the Roman pound
was not the only standard of weight which was in
customary use in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The gold
mina of
200 gold
solidi.</div>

<p>We have seen that the commonly prevalent
wergeld of 200 gold solidi was in fact the same thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in wheat-grains, as the heavy Eastern and Greek
gold mina of 19,200 wheat-grains. But besides
this, there were two other minas of interest to this
inquiry which seem to have been more or less
locally in use, and more or less connected with the
wergelds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>mina
Italica</i>
of 240
scripula
of 24
wheat-grains
or
20 Roman
ounces.</div>

<p>It seems that the Roman pound of 12 ounces was
not the only pound in use in Italy. A still older
Roman pound of 10 Roman ounces or 5760 wheat-grains
seems to have existed,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which was in fact a
pound of 240 scripula of 24 wheat-grains. And two
of these pounds made what was called the <i>mina Italica</i>
of 20 Roman ounces. This mina Italica survived
into Merovingian times. It contained 480 Roman
scripula, and according to authorities quoted by
Hultsch<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the <i>scripulum</i> was so far a common unit in
Gaul as to have earned the name of the <i>denarius
Gallicus</i>. The number of Roman wheat-grains in
the mina Italica was 11,520. Its weight was 545
grammes.</p>

<p>In the Merovingian formulæ and in the early
charters of St. Gall there are constant references to
fines of so many <i>libræ</i> of gold and so many <i>pondera</i>
of silver, from which the inference may be drawn
that the pondus of silver was a different weight from
the libra of gold. Whether the older Roman pound
or half-mina-Italica was the ‘pondus’ or not, the
fact that it consisted of 240 scripula may possibly
have made it a precedent for the monetary mode of
reckoning of 240 pence to the pound, adopted by the
Franks and Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>This mina Italica has also a Celtic interest.
It is curious to note that whilst so late as the
tenth century the Cymric galanas or wergeld was
paid in cows, the cow was equated with a monetary
reckoning in scores of pence, or <i>unciæ argenti</i>, of
which twelve made a pound of 240 pence. At the same
time in the Cymric Codes there are mentioned, as we
shall find, two kinds of pence: the <i>legal</i> pence, probably
those current at the time in England of 32 w.g.,
and the <i>curt</i> pence or scripula of one third less, viz.
24 w.g. Now, whilst 240 of the former would equal the
pound of the <i>nova moneta</i> of Charlemagne, and of later
Anglo-Saxon reckoning, 240 of the <i>curt</i> pence or
scripula would equal the older Roman pound or half-mina-Italica.</p>

<p>Turning from the Cymric monetary system to that
of the early Irish manuscripts and Brehon laws, we
shall find that it was based on the Roman scripulum
of 24 wheat-grains, and not, like the Anglo-Saxon and
Frankish system, on the tremissis. And we shall find
that though thus based upon the scripulum and the
ounce, when payments were made in gold and silver,
the reckoning, instead of making use of the Roman or
any other pound, counted rather in <i>scores of ounces</i>;
<i>i.e.</i> consciously or unconsciously, in so many of the
mina Italica.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The <i>mina
Attica</i> of
16 Roman
ounces or
2 marks.</div>

<p>So much for the <i>mina Italica</i> and its possible
Anglo-Saxon and Celtic connections.</p>

<p>The other mina, the mention of which is important,
formed the probable basis of Scandinavian
reckoning in <i>marks</i> instead of in pounds.</p>

<p>The authorities collected by Hultsch describe this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
mina as of 16 Roman ounces, and as the ‘<i>mina Attica</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
It is a fact that 16 Roman ounces did exactly equal
in weight (though not in wheat-grains) the light
mina of 50 Attic staters or 100 drachmas. But
under Roman influence this Attic mina no longer was
divided like a mina into 100 drachmas, but had
become twisted, as it were, into 16 Roman ounces and
into 96 solidi of Constantine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mark,
ore, and
ortug of
Scandinavia.</div>

<p>In Northern Europe, in nearly all the systems
of reckoning which survived from mediæval times,
the pound of 12 ounces was ignored. A pound of
16 ounces had taken its place. And this pound or
mina of 16 ounces lay, as we shall find, at the root of
the system of the earliest Scandinavian laws, with its
monetary marks, ores, and ortugs, for it was the double
of the <i>mark</i> of 8 ounces. The Russian zolotnic (or
‘gold piece’), on which the weight system of Russia
is based, was theoretically identical in wheat-grains
with the Roman solidus, and the Scandinavian ortug
with the double solidus or stater.</p>

<p>It is not needful to dwell further upon these points
at this moment; but it will become important
to recognise the Byzantine or Eastern origin of the
mina of 16 Roman ounces when we come to consider
the wergelds of Northern Europe, and particularly
the equation between the Danish wergeld of 8 half-marks
of gold and the silver wergelds of Wessex
and Mercia as described in the compact between
Alfred and Guthrum.</p>

<p>In that compact we shall have to recognise not
only the contact of two methods of monetary reckoning
widely separated in origin, the one of gold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the other of silver, but also the clashing of two
traditional ratios between the two metals, viz. the
Scandinavian ratio of 1:8, and the restored Imperial
ratio of 1:12 followed by the Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<h3>VI. THE USE OF GOLD TORQUES AND ARMLETS, &amp;C.,
INSTEAD OF COINS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds
paid in
cattle or
gold or
silver by
weight.</div>

<p>Although the amounts of the wergelds are
generally stated in the laws in gold or silver currency,
more or less directly equated with the cattle in which
they were originally paid, it would be a great
mistake to imagine that the wergelds were often
paid actually in coin.</p>

<p>A moment’s consideration makes it clear that a
wergeld of a hundred head of cattle, whether paid as
of old in cattle or in gold or silver, was a payment
too large to be paid in <i>coin</i>. It was a payment that
no ordinary individual could pay without the aid of
his kindred, and it is hardly likely that so large an
amount in actual coin could be collected even from
the kindred of the murderer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold
torques
&amp;c. made
of a
certain
weight
and used
in payments.</div>

<p>There is plenty of evidence to show that large
payments in gold and silver were mostly made by
weight, and very often in gold articles&mdash;torques,
armlets, and bracelets&mdash;made to a certain weight.</p>

<p>In the Scald’s tale is the well-known passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He to me a beag gave</div>
<div class="verse">On which six hundred was</div>
<div class="verse">Of beaten gold</div>
<div class="verse">Scored of sceatts</div>
<div class="verse">In scillings reckoned.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Whether the true meaning be six hundred sceatts or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
six hundred scillings, we have here a beag with its
weight marked upon it.</p>

<p>The museums of Scandinavia and of Ireland&mdash;the
two poles of German and Celtic culture&mdash;are full of
these gold objects, and very frequently little coils of
fine gold wire are wound round them to raise their
weight to the required standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold and
silver
objects
weighing
so many
mancuses.</div>

<p>It may be mentioned, further, in passing, that
in many early Anglo-Saxon charters payments and
donations are made in gold and silver objects, and
that the weights of these are sometimes stated in so
many <i>mancuses</i>&mdash;the mancus being apparently a
weight of gold or silver of 30 pence, and equated in
the later laws, in its silver value, with the value of
the ox.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">An historical
example.</div>

<p>It may be worth while before concluding this
chapter to refer to an historic example of the use of
gold objects of definite weight, and the adjustment
of their value in differing currencies. The incident
deserves to be noticed, and may be of use in helping
to fix upon the memory the difference, so often
alluded to, between the Roman pound of 6912 wheat-grains
and Charlemagne’s pound of 7680 wheat-grains.
It belongs to the precise moment when
Charlemagne, having issued his <i>nova moneta</i>, was
contemplating his visit to Rome and the assumption
of the Imperial title, and it has an historical interest
as showing that the <i>nova moneta</i> was issued before
the Imperial title was assumed.</p>

<p>Alcuin, who had long resided at the Court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Charlemagne, was now lying ill at Tours. In order
to consult him, probably respecting the Imperial title,
Charlemagne, with his queen Liutgarda, proceeded
to visit him at Tours. Liutgarda was apparently
taken ill while there, and died June 4 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 800.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alcuin
weighs
gold
bracelets
in the
scales of
the <i>nova
moneta</i>.</div>

<p>During her illness Alcuin sent a messenger to
Paulinus, the Patriarch of Aquileia, with two
<i>armillæ</i> of fine gold from Liutgarda,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> so that he and
his priests might pray for her. He stated in his
letter to Paulinus that these armillæ weighed ‘xxiv.
denarii less than a full pound of the <i>nova moneta</i>
of the king.’</p>

<p>Alcuin thus weighed the bracelets in the scales
of the <i>nova moneta</i>, and they weighed twenty-four
pence less than Charlemagne’s pound of 7680 wheat-grains.
The interesting point is that 24 pence of the
<i>nova moneta</i> (24 × 32 = 768) deducted from the pound
of Charlemagne left exactly 6912 wheat-grains.
So that when Paulinus weighed the gold bracelets in
his Roman scales he would find they weighed exactly

<div class="sidenote">But in

<p>And yet, though writing from Charlemagne’s
Court, Alcuin, when addressing his ecclesiastical
friends in Ireland, no longer used the terms of the
Frankish currency. It was after all a local one.
Charlemagne’s Empire had its limits, and Ireland
was beyond them. The area of ecclesiastical rule was
wider than both Empires put together. Alcuin
writes that he and his Imperial master had distributed
among the Irish monasteries so many <i>sicli</i> of silver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The <i>siclus</i>, according to the authorities collected by
Hultsch,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> was equal to two Roman <i>argentei</i> or drachmas
of silver. So that Alcuin used the di-drachma or

Nero, when corresponding with churches outside the
Empire of his Frankish master.</p>

Roman monetary terms in replying to the question
of his clergy respecting the wergelds to be claimed
in taking their proper position and rank in the
Northumbrian kingdom. The answer was given in
Roman <i>argentei</i> and <i>sicli</i>, and not in Frankish solidi,
or Anglo-Saxon scillings, or any other local currency.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the various currencies in which
wergelds were paid may at first sight be perplexing,
but the relevance of the facts stated in this chapter
to a right understanding of the wergelds of various
tribes under tribal custom, and of the amount of
the wergelds to a right understanding of the constitution
of tribal society, will become more and
more apparent as the inquiry proceeds.</p>

<h3>I. THE UNIT OF CYMRIC TRIBAL SOCIETY.</h3>

<p>The next step in this inquiry will be to give a brief
summary of the results of the evidence contained in
the volume on the ‘Tribal System in Wales,’ adding
at the same time such further details as may be useful
in helping us to realise the methods by which tribal
custom worked itself out in practice.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Cymric
unit of
landholding
was
the gwely.</div>

<p>The chief fact revealed by the examination of the
Extents and Surveys of different parts of Wales made
after the English conquest, taken together with the
Cymric Codes, was that the unit of society and of
land-occupation under Cymric tribal custom was not
the individual, and not the immediate family, but the
group of kindred known as the ‘<i>Wele</i>’ or ‘<i>Gwely</i>.’</p>

<p>Such and such a Villata or District is described
in the surveys as in the occupation of the gwelys of
so and so, the Latin word used for gwely being
‘lectus’ or bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The gwely
was a
family
group of a
great-grandfather
and
his descendants.</div>

<p>The form of society thus revealed was <i>patriarchal</i>
in the sense that the common ancestor (generally
conceived to be the great-grandfather) during his life,
and even after his death, was regarded as the head
of the <i>gwely</i> or group of his descendants for three
generations. In his name as its head this family
group occupied land and had grazing rights over
certain districts, sometimes alone, more often in
common with other family groups.</p>

<p>As to what is meant by land ownership in the
full modern sense, the question may not have arisen,
or it might have come in gradually sooner or later,
as agriculture came more and more into prominence.
What property, strictly speaking, the tribesmen owned
consisted mainly of herds of cattle.</p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, what rights over land they
may have had were mainly rights of occupation and
grazing in certain districts for their herds. Their
agriculture was secondary, and consisted of the right
to plough up such portions of the waste or common
pasture as year by year might be required for their
corn crop. All that need be said at this moment
about their agriculture is that it was an open field
husbandry, the result of the co-ploughing of a common
plough-team normally of 8 oxen, the joint contribution
of several tribesmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
young
tribesman
is dependent
on the
chief, not
on his
father. The
tribesmen
recover
their <i>da</i>
or cattle
from him
as their
chief for
their
maintenance.</div>

<p>Returning to the gwely, we find that when a child
was born into it, whether boy or girl, it was formally
acknowledged by the kindred. It remained ‘at the
father’s platter’ to a certain age (generally 14), and
then the father ceased to be responsible. The boy
at 14 became the ‘man and kin’ of the chieftain of
the family group, or it might be of the higher kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
embracing several of the gwelys. From that moment
the boy obtained by ‘kin and descent’ a tribesman’s
right of maintenance. That is to say, he received
from the chieftain his <i>da</i>, probably in the form of an
allotment of cattle,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and with it the right to join in the
co-ploughing of the waste. He became thus a tribesman
on his own hook, apart from his father. So
that the unit of society was not simply the family in
the modern sense of a parent and his children, but the
wider kindred of the gwely or the group of related
gwelys headed by the chieftain who provided
the <i>da</i>.</p>

<h3>II. THE CONSTITUTION AND WORKING OF THE
GWELY.</h3>

<p>Now, as the gwely was the unit of land-occupation,
it is worth while to try to realise a little further what
it was and how it worked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
simplest
form of
the gwely.
The
landed
rights
vested in
the chief,
and he
gives
cattle out
of the
common
herd to
tribesmen
for their
maintenance.</div>

<p>Viewed in its simplest, and perhaps original form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
it was a family group of four generations, the landed
rights of which were vested in the great-grandfather
as its chieftain.</p>

<p>The tribesmen, his descendants, had only rights
of maintenance. By right of ‘kin and descent’
they had received their <i>da</i> from the chieftain. The
flocks and herds of the chieftain were the common
stock out of which the <i>da</i> had been given, and there
is reason to believe that under earlier custom, on the
death of a tribesman, his <i>da</i> went back into the
common stock of the chieftain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Probably
at first no
succession
by representation
on a
tribesman’s
death.
But in the
codes a
<i>peculium</i>
admitted
which
went to
children.</div>

<p>At the date of the codes it did so when the
tribesman died <i>without issue</i>. But in the codes a
<i>peculium</i> of private property of which the <i>da</i> was the
kernel is recognised and allowed to descend to a
tribesman’s children instead of falling into the
common stock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A redivision
takes
place <i>per
capita</i> as
each
generation
dies
off.</div>

<p>When the great-grandfather died, the chieftainship,
with the landed rights and the herds, was
divided between his sons, who as brothers thus
became chiefs of sub-gwelys. But the original
gwely did not then break up, because there would
be a right of division <i>per capita</i> when the brothers
were dead between first cousins, and when the first
cousins were dead between second cousins.</p>

<p>The division between brothers was probably
originally made only between those sons of the
parent who were living at his death. Like the sons
of the surviving brothers, the sons of a deceased
brother must be content with their <i>da</i> till all the
brothers were dead, and in the division between
first cousins they would take their share <i>per capita</i>
along with the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>But at the time of the codes, by what Continental
examples lead us to regard as an innovation, the
orphaned nephews were allowed in the division to
succeed at once, side by side with their uncles, to
the share and position which their father would have
taken had he survived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rights
and property
of a
tribesman
dying
without
issue fall
into the
common
stock.</div>

<p>Even after this innovation, if a brother had died
<i>without issue</i>, his brothers as brothers did not at
once succeed as co-heirs. The share fell into the
common stock till a division, and then went to all
the co-inheritors <i>per capita</i>, so that cousins, and
it might be even second cousins, took their shares
in it.</p>

<p>The introduction of succession by representation
to a deceased father’s property and privilege
was, as we shall see in Continental cases, a step
taken in the direction of individual ownership.
It complicated the matter of the division or devolution
of the chieftainship in the gwely, but it is a
point of interest in connection with the Continental
evidence.</p>

<p>A clear understanding of the constitution and
working of the gwely, as a typical family group,
is so important to this inquiry that it is worth
while to place before the reader the passages in
codes upon which, taken together with the surveys,
the foregoing description of it rests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clauses in
the Venedotian
Code.</div>

<p>The following is the clause in the Venedotian
Code describing what took place in the gwely,
under the heading ‘The Law of Brothers for
Land:’</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Thus, brothers are to share land between them: four erws to
every tyddyn [homestead]. Bleddyn, son of Cynvyn, altered it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to twelve erws to the uchelwr, and eight to the aillt, and four to
the godaeog; yet, nevertheless, it is most usual that four erws be
in the tyddyn.…</p>

<p>If there be no buildings on the land, the youngest son is to
divide all the patrimony (trew y tat), and the eldest is to choose,
and each in seniority choose unto the youngest.</p>

<p>If there be buildings the youngest brother but one is to divide
the tyddyns, for in that case he is the meter; and the youngest to
have his choice of the tyddyns; and after that he is to divide all
the patrimony; and by seniority they are to choose unto the
youngest; and that division is to continue during the lives of the
brothers.</p>

<p>And after the brothers are dead, the first cousins are to
equalise if they will it; and thus they are to do: the heir of the
youngest brother is to equalise, and the heir of the eldest brother
is to choose, and so by seniority unto the youngest; and that
distribution is to continue between them during their lives.</p>

<p>And if second cousins should dislike the distribution which
took place between their parents, they also may co-equate in the
same manner as the first cousins; and after that division no one
is either to distribute or to co-equate. Tir gwelyauc is to be
treated as we have above stated.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Clauses
in the
Dimetian
Code.</div>

<p>In the Dimetian Code the same rules of division
are stated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When brothers share their patrimony (tref-eu-tat) between
them, the youngest is to have the principal tyddyn, and all the
buildings of his father, and eight erws of land, his boiler, his fuel
hatchet, and his coulter, because a father cannot give those three
to any but the youngest son, and though they should be pledged
they never become forfeited. Then let every brother take a
homestead (eissydyn) with eight erws of land, and the youngest
son is to share, and they are to choose in succession from the
eldest to the youngest.</p>

<p>Three times shall the same patrimony be shared between
three grades of a kindred, first between brothers, the second time
between cousins, the third time between second cousins, after
that there is no propriate share of land.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After there shall have been a sharing of land acquiesced in
by co-inheritors, no one of them has a claim on the share of
the other, he having issue, except for a sub-share <i>when the time
for that shall arrive</i>. Yet whosoever shall not have any issue
of his body, <i>his co-inheritors, within the three degrees of kin
from the stock, are to be his heirs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Only by adhering very closely to these texts
can the gwely be understood. They seem at first
sight to refer to the tyddyns or homesteads, but,
as we have seen, the landed rights of grazing in
the villatæ in which the gwelys were located were
included also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the
divisions
worked
out in
practice.</div>

<p>It would obviously be a fair critical question to
ask, what happened when the second cousins at last
broke up the gwely of their grandfather and divided
the land, or let us say the homesteads and the tribal
rights of grazing on the land, for the last time equally
<i>per capita</i>? There might be twenty or thirty of such
second cousins. Did the original gwely split up into
twenty or thirty new gwelys? Let us try to realise
what happened by carefully following the text, in the
light of the Denbigh Survey.</p>

<p>Let us take a hypothetical case in which the
gwely of X is described by the surveyor as holding
an undivided share of the rights of pasture, &amp;c., in a
particular villata or in several villatæ; and assume
that, according to the record, the internal divisions
of the gwely followed the family division of the
descendants of X, as in the following table. Then,
applying the rules of the clauses as to <i>tir gwelyauc</i>,
let us see how it would work out in the hypothetical
case stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="genealogy">

   Aᵃᵃ       Aᵇᵃ     Aᵇᵇ  Bᵃᵃ   Bᵃᵇ  Bᵇᵃ Bᵇᵇ Bᵇᶜ  Bᶜᵃ
</p>

</div>

<p>Now let us suppose that X (the great-grandfather,
from whom the gwely is called the gwely of X) is
dead. While his sons A and B are alive they share
equally in the grazing and other rights. When A is
dead and so long as B is alive no change is made
except that A’s two sons share equally their father’s
right to which, in the phrase of the codes, they have
‘ascended.’ B at length dies. There are five grandsons,
first cousins, who have a right to share in the
rights of the gwely of X <i>per capita</i>. There is now
therefore a rearrangement after which A’s sons share
and hold jointly only 2-5ths, while B’s three sons
hold jointly 3-5ths. Equality <i>per capita</i> among
grandsons has now been effected. But the gwely
goes on. It cannot be broken up because in another
generation the great-grandsons may require a fresh
division.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The process
is a
continuous
one.</div>

<p>Next let us see what happens when all the grandsons
are dead and the final division <i>per capita</i> takes
place. There are nine great-grandsons. Is the
gwely of X now to be divided into nine new gwelys?
Certainly not. The grandsons of A are entitled to
3-9ths only, and this they divide <i>per capita</i>, being
first cousins; one family takes 1-3rd and the other
2-3rds. The portion which has fallen to them of
family rights in the gwely of X has become a separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gwely, called either the gwely of A or, as we sometimes
find in the Denbigh Survey, the ‘gwely of the
grandsons of A’&mdash;‘<i>gwely weiryon A</i>.’ The other portion
has become either the gwely of B or the gwely
of the grandsons of B&mdash;‘<i>gwely weiryon B</i>.’</p>

<p>The grandsons of B, being first cousins, have of
course redivided their 6/9ths equally <i>per capita</i>, and
the internal rights of the gwely of the grandsons of
B are</p>

<table summary="How the rights are divided">
  <tr>
    <td>Bᵃ’s two children have 2/6ths.</td>
    <td rowspan="3" class="valign"><span class="x2">}</span> of 6/9ths.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bᵇ’s three children have 3/6ths.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bᶜ’s one son has 1/6th.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>They cannot break up the gwely of ‘the grandsons
of B’ because they are not second cousins. But
when all of them are dead, their children will be
second cousins and may do so, and then three new
gwelys will be formed in the same way as above, and
so on for ever. The process is continuous and
always within the same rules of ‘tir gwelyauc.’</p>

<p>This seems to be the state of things as regards
succession within the gwely resulting from the rules
laid down in the Codes and found at work by the
surveyors of the Lordship of the Honour of Denbigh.
But we must remember that, apart from these rights
of succession, each tribesman on becoming a tribesman
had been the recipient of his <i>da</i>, and so had had
cattle of his own all along in the common herd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rights
of females
in the
gwely.</div>

<p>Finally, the position of females in the gwely should
not pass without recognition. They are not mentioned
in the statements of landed rights because,
provision having been made for their maintenance
independently of their father, they were assumed,
whilst claiming their ‘gwaddol’ or portion, to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
this with them, on marriage, out of the gwely. They
ought to be married into another gwely, within
which their sons in due course would receive
inheritance and landed rights by paternity. Only
on failure of this could their sons claim landed rights
by maternity in their mother’s original gwely.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h3>III. THE LIABILITY OF THE WIDER KINDRED FOR
<i>GALANAS</i> IN CASE OF HOMICIDE.</h3>

<p>Such being the <i>gwely</i>, we pass on to the wider
kindred, embracing the descendants of seven (and
for some purposes nine) generations from a common
ancestor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
galanas
in lieu of
blood feud
between
kindreds
for homicide,
but
none
within the
kindred.</div>

<p>We find from the Cymric Codes that the members
of the wider kindred had common responsibilities in
case of a homicide causing a blood feud between
kindreds. A murder <i>within</i> this wider kindred was
regarded as a family matter. The murderer was too
near of blood to be slain. No atonement could be
made for so unnatural a crime. There was no blood
fine or ‘galanas’ within the kindred. The murderer
must be exiled. But a murder of a member of one
kindred by the member of another, inasmuch as, if
unatoned for, it would under tribal custom have
produced a blood feud between the two kindreds,
was the proper subject for the substituted payment
of the blood fine or ‘galanas.’ The galanas was thus
a payment from one kindred to another in lieu of the
blood feud. But its amount was divided in payment
on one side and in distribution on the other, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
varying proportion according to nearness of relationship
to the murderer or the murdered person as the
case might be. And in these payments and receipts
all the individual tribesmen within the kindred who
had received their <i>da</i> must take their share if needful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Payment
and receipt
by
maternal
as well as
by paternal
relations.</div>

<p>The question who had to pay and who had to
receive was moreover complicated further by the
fact that it involved maternal relations as well as
paternal relations. It has been very properly pointed
out that, however it might be as regards money
payments, it is difficult to conceive how the liability
of maternal relations could be worked in the case of
actual blood feud and fighting. A man might have
to fight for his maternal relations against his paternal
relations, or the reverse. In such a case what must
he do? How should he act? He might be in an
impossible position.</p>

<p>Light upon this point and others may be obtained,
perhaps, when the evidence of ‘Beowulf’ is analysed.
This evidence will show that a man may have good
cause under tribal custom not to join in some feuds.
And further it will remind us that feuds often arose
in contravention of tribal usage, breaking the peace
which in theory the link of marriage ought to have
secured.</p>

<p>In the meantime it would seem possible that the
custom of a tribe might, for anything we know, forbid
marriage <i>within</i> the near relationships of the gwely,
and <i>beyond</i> the limits of the wider kindred. In such
a case, paternal and maternal relations might all be
within the kindred, so that properly speaking a
quarrel between them could not become the subject
of a feud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Marriage
a link
between
two
gwelys.
But as
regards
galanas
the wife
remained
in her own
kindred.</div>

<p>In such matters it is obvious that a good deal
must depend upon the view taken of marriage itself
at the particular stage of evolution in which the
society might be. And it may as well be said at
once that we should be quite wrong were we to
regard marriage from the Roman point of view, <i>i.e.</i> as
a transfer of the woman out of the <i>potestas</i> of her
parents into the <i>potestas</i> of the husband. The Cymric
example, to begin with, was quite different. The
marriage of sisters to tribesmen from whom their
sons could inherit tribal rights was a duty cast upon
the kinsmen of the gwely.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It was thus an arrangement
between two gwelys&mdash;a link between them&mdash;but
no transfer. If a wife were slain, her galanas or
death fine did not go to the husband and his family;
it went to her kindred.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> If a wife should commit
murder, it was the wife’s family and not the husband’s
on which rested the payment of galanas for her
crime.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> If the husband were killed the wife took one
third of the saraad or fine for insult and wounding, but
she took no part of the galanas of her husband.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>These points are in a sense unexpected. They
belong to a stage of social life as far removed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Roman rules, or modern ones, as they are from
the stage in which a wife was either purchased outright
or stolen. And yet we shall find them in
principle more or less clearly repeated in the varying
customs of some of the tribes whose laws we are
about to examine.</p>

<h3>IV. THE FISCAL UNIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF
FOOD-RENTS TO THE CHIEFTAINS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The geographical
unit for
food rents.</div>

<p>The structure of tribal society in Wales is one
thing. The practical working of its rules is another.
Until we can to some extent realise its methods and
see how its results could be worked out in everyday
life, it must remain to some extent vague and mysterious.
The nearer we get to its core, the greater
its value as an instrument in further research.</p>

<p>We cannot, therefore, afford to disregard any
hints that the Codes and surveys may give us,
attention to which would help us to realise its methods
or ways of working.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Districts
called
<i>villatæ</i>.</div>

<p>The Denbigh Extent, as already said, enables us to
realise that, on the English conquest, the lordship of
Denbigh was divided into grazing districts which
had become the units of tribal food-rents, and which
were adopted for purposes of future taxation. These
districts were called by the scribes <i>villatæ</i>, and were
occupied by gwelys of tribesmen and sometimes also
by gwelys of non-tribesmen. Their homesteads or
huts were occupied in severalty. Their grazing
rights were undivided common rights, and within
each gwely the rights of families and individuals
were also undivided common rights.</p>

<p>Further, the Denbigh Extent shows how easy it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was to shift the whole body of tribesmen of this or
that gwely, with its herds, from one district to another,
according to convenience or the needs of population,
without disturbing the complex rights within the
gwely. The families and individuals carried their
rights, <i>inter se</i>, with them wherever they and their
herds might go, and were liable to pay the dues
required from whatever villata for the time being
might be occupied by them.</p>

<p>Even the homesteads of the tribesmen seem to
have been temporary, in the light of the description
given by Giraldus Cambrensis. They could
carry their hearth-stones with them wherever they
went, so that the result seems to be that the groups
of kindreds could always have been easily shifted
about, as they were in fact after the English conquest,
from one district or ‘villata’ to another.
The geographical divisions thus became the permanent
fiscal units in tribal arrangements. Both
in the surveys and in the Codes we find the
villata or district, and not the family group, the fixed
unit for tribal food-rents to the chieftain, and for
taxation after the English conquest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
‘tref’ or
‘maenol’
paying the
‘tunc
pound.’</div>

<p>The surveys so far agree with the Codes. The
<i>villata</i> of the surveys was the taxable unit, and in
some cases still paid the tunc pound (or 20<i>s.</i>) in lieu
of the chieftain’s food-rents. In other cases escheats
and other causes had varied the amount. In the
Codes of South Wales the unit for the tunc pound
was the <i>tref</i>, and in the Venedotian Code of North
Wales the <i>maenol</i> of four trefs.</p>

<p>Now, as in the surveys the family groups or
gwelys were located so as to occupy sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
several villatæ, and sometimes undivided shares in
villatæ along with others, so, if we may take the
villata of the surveys as equivalent to the tref or
maenol of the Codes, we must expect to find that the
kindreds of tribesmen at the period of the Codes
were scattered in the same way over the trefs
and maenols. And, as the maenol was a group
of trefs, the <i>tref</i> is the unit of tribal occupation
as to which a clear understanding is most necessary.
In this, however, we may be, after all, only partly
successful.</p>

<p>The word <i>tref</i>, though generally used for a homestead
or hamlet, seems from its other meanings to
involve the idea of a <i>group</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The tref
and its
‘randirs.’</div>

<p>There were cases in which a disputed matter of
fact had to be established upon the evidence of men
of the <i>gorvotref</i>, <i>i.e.</i> by men of the groups outside the
tref in which the question in dispute arose.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And this
<i>gorvotref</i> was not merely the next adjoining tref or
trefs, but it consisted of those <i>randirs</i> or divisions of
neighbouring trefs of uchelwrs, or tribesmen, whose
boundaries touched the tref in which the disputed
facts arose. Neighbouring randirs of taeog trefs, <i>i.e.</i>
the trefs of non-tribesmen, were excluded, presumably
because the testimony of taeogs in matters relating
to tribesmen was not relied on. But this compound
of the word tref implies that its general sense was a
group of homesteads. That, in general, trefs had
defined boundaries, is clear from the fact that it was
an offence to break them, and this applied also to the
randirs or divisions of the tref.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
trefgordd
of one
herd and
one
plough.</div>

<p>Speaking, then, of the group generally known as
a tref, we must regard it, not only as a taxable
area, but also as the natural group known everywhere
as a <i>trefgordd</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the natural group of the
homesteads of relatives or neighbours acting together
as a single community as regards their cattle and
their ploughing.</p>

<p>The typical lawful <i>trefgordd</i> is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This is the complement of a lawful <i>trefgordd</i>: nine houses
and one plough and one oven (odyn) and one churn (<i>gordd</i>) and
one cat and one cock and one bull and one herdsman.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is another passage which mentions the
nine buildings in the tref.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>These persons do not forfeit life.…</p>

<p>The necessitous for the theft of food after he has traversed
three trevs, and nine houses in each trev, without obtaining a gift
though asked for.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So, in case of fire from negligence in a tref, the
holder of the house in which it arose was to pay for
the damage to the next houses on each side if they
took fire.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And again no indemnity was to be paid
to the owners in a trefgordd for damages from the
fire of a smithy if covered with shingles or tiles or
sods, nor from the fire of a bath, provided always that
the smithy and the bath were at least seven fathoms
from the other houses in the trefgordd.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Not
always of
one gwely
only.</div>

<p>The description above quoted of the normal
trefgordd suggests that the herd under the one
herdsman did not belong to one person or homestead,
but to many; and so far it seems to be
consistent with the surveys which represent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
villatæ as occupied by the cattle of several family
groups who had grazing rights therein.</p>

<p>And this, too, accords with what the Denbigh
Extent tells us of the individual tribesmen, viz.
that only some of them had homesteads. So-and-so
‘habet domum’ or ‘non habet domum.’<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The young
tribesman with his <i>da</i> thus may have joined in a
common homestead with some one else&mdash;probably
with his parents or near relatives.</p>

<p>Distinguishing, then, the tref as a taxable area
from the trefgordd, and still confining attention to
the trefgordd as a cluster of homesteads united for
the practical purpose of occupation, let us recur to
the things which bound the trefgordd into one group,
viz. the one plough, the one oven, the one churn, the
one bull, and the one herdsman.</p>

<p>Here are the two elements combined of pastoral
and agricultural co-operation, and the trefgordd is
the local and physical unit of this co-operation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The unit
of co-operative
dairy
farming.
The
common
herdsman
and his
dog.</div>

<p>Taking first the pastoral element, the trefgordd
was a working unit of co-operative dairy-farming.
The cattle of several households or individuals were
put together in a common herd with a common bull
and under the care of a common herdsman (bugeil)
and his dog. It may be regarded as a group of the
homesteads of the persons in charge of such a herd,
and the tribesmen of a gwely may have cattle in the
herds of more than one trefgordd.</p>

<p>Three things were ‘ornamental’ to a trefgordd,
‘a book, a teacher versed in song, and a smith (gov)
in his smithy;’ but a trefgordd herdsman was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
‘indispensable’ of the <i>hendrev</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and, when engaged
with his herd in summer on the mountain, <i>his</i> ‘three
indispensables’ were ‘a bothy, his herdsman’s dog,
and a knife;’ and the three indispensables of his
bothy were a roof-tree, roof-supporting forks, and
wattling, and he was at liberty to cut them in any wild
wood he pleased.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>So far, then, as the pastoral element was concerned,
the trefgordd was occupied by a little group of tribesmen
engaged in dairy-farming having charge of cattle
in a common herd, with a common bull, and under
the care of a common herdsman and his dog.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The herd
of 24 kine.</div>

<p>Custom, grown out of traditional experience of
what a single herdsman and his dog could manage,
had determined, it seems, the size of the normal herd.
Thus in the Gwentian Code<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> we are told that ‘a
legal herd of cattle is 24 kine.’ And custom tenaciously
adhered to tribal rules in such matters.</p>

<p>Thus in the Denbigh Extent it is mentioned that
the whole villata of Arquedelok was <i>in manu domini</i>
by reason of escheats and exchanges, and that a
portion of it was let <i>ad firmam</i> to nine firmarii, each
of whom held for a term of years 31 acres, with one
bull and 24 cows, paying per annum 73<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and rendering
to the lord at the end of his term the said
bull and cows or their price, together with the land
and a house built thereon.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Here, even in a case in
which Henry de Lacy was introducing into Wales
holdings and herds in severalty, and very possibly
introducing English tenants, he adhered to the Welsh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
tribal rule of the one bull and 24 cows to the herd.
So also in the survey of St. David’s, under the head
<i>Glaston</i> in Breconshire, the number 24 of <i>grossa
animalia</i> is spoken of as the usual number <i>ab antiqua
consuetudine</i>, and in the arrangement of common
pasture one great animal is said to count as equal to
twelve sheep.</p>

<p>The normal herd of the trefgordd was then 24
cows, or their equivalent in bullocks and sheep.</p>

<p>During the summer months the herdsman living
out on the mountains was responsible with his dog
for the cattle of the trefgordd. And his dog was
worth as much as a cow or an ox, if it was one that
‘will go <i>before</i> the herd in the morning and <i>behind</i>
them in the evening, and make three turns <i>round</i>
them in the night.’<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Having no cattle of his own in the herd, the herdsman’s
testimony as to whose cattle were injured, and
as to whose cattle had done the injury, was held,
when such cases arose, to be sufficient to make the
owner responsible, while as regards injuries done by
the cattle of one trefgordd to those of another there
was joint responsibility.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> There is common sense in
such rules to begin with, and then, having grown into
custom, they become perpetuated when custom is
codified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
common
churn.</div>

<p>The trefgordd possessed further a common churn.
This implies that the milk of the cows was thrown
altogether into this one churn as in Swiss mountain
communes now. One of the dues from a taeog trev,
<i>i.e.</i> a group of <i>non</i>-tribesmen, was a cheese made from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a day’s milking of all the cows in the herd. So that
we note in passing that the taeog-tref, <i>i.e.</i> of non-tribesmen,
also had its herd and was in fact a trefgordd.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In winter the cattle came down into the lowlands
and grazed on the pastures near the tyddyns or
homesteads of the tref, and as each of these had its
corn and cattle-yard,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> we may conclude that each
owner penned in his own cattle at night during the
winter months or joined with some other tribesmen
who had a homestead in doing so. The rules as to
the divisions of the tyddyns probably referred to these
winter homesteads so held in quasi-severalty.</p>

<p>We need not dwell upon the common <i>oven</i>.
Every hamlet in Brittany possesses its common oven
to this day, often in the middle of the village green.
Nor need we more than mention the common plough,
to the team of which the tribesmen contributed
oxen for the <i>cyvar</i> or common ploughing of the
portion of the waste agreed upon for each year’s corn
crop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
trefgordd
the unit
for food
rents.
The
tribesmen
could be
shifted
about.</div>

<p>The attempt to realise what this practical unit&mdash;the
trefgordd&mdash;was, will not be thrown away if it
should help us to understand how easily it lent itself
to the arrangement of the chieftain’s food-rents or
tribute in after-times of taxation. Granted that
some such system of trefgordds or clusters of
trefgordds pretty generally prevailed, having grown
up as a matter of convenience in a grazing community,
it is obvious how easily it might become the
unit of tribute or taxation. Just as in the Domesday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Survey the number of ploughs affords such a unit,
so in a tribal community a district might easily be
fiscally estimated at so many herds, or so many
churns, or so many ploughs. All these would mean
so many trefgordds. And whatever the relations of
the trefgordd to the villata of the surveys might be,
and however much or often the actual residents, with
their herds, might be shifted from one district to
another, the district, as in the Denbigh Extent, would
remain the permanent unit for payments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>firma
unius
noctis</i>.
Afterwards
commuted
into
money
payments.</div>

<p>In the early stages of tribal life, when the chieftain
of the tribe moved from one district to another
and received his food-rents in the actual form of ‘the
night’s entertainment,’ each customary place of encampment
in his annual progress would become the
centre at which the food-rents would be paid and
services rendered for as many nights’ entertainment
as his accustomed stay in the place. In later stages,
when the chieftain’s dues were commuted into money,
the ‘tunc pound’ in lieu of food-rents easily became,
as we find it in the surveys, a charge on the district
rather than on the shifting tribesmen and their
herds.</p>

<p>And when the power of the chieftain had grown with
time, and instead of ‘nights’ entertainments’ obtained
in the primitive way by the actual movement of himself
and his retinue from place to place, the food-rents
or the tunc pounds in lieu of them were delivered at
his palace, he would become the recipient of a
regular revenue. And out of this revenue it would
become easy for him to reward a follower or endow
a church by the transfer of so many food-rents or
tunc pounds in lieu of them, or the revenue from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
such and such a district, or of so many of its trefgordds,
without disturbing the internal working of
the system or the daily life of the tribesmen and
their herds. When Beowulf returns to his chieftain
after his exploit and is rewarded by the gift of a
palace and so many ‘thousands,’ we naturally ask of
what, and how it could be done. We may not be
able to say off-hand what the unit was, but we
get from the Welsh example some rough idea of what
tribal tribute and income were, and how these could
be readily gathered and transferred.</p>

<h3>V. THE METHOD OF PAYMENT OF GALANAS BETWEEN
KINDREDS.</h3>

<p>Postponing for a while the consideration of the
position of the various classes of non-tribesmen, but
still keeping in view the fact that in considerable
numbers they were practically sharers with the tribesmen
in the rights of grazing and occupation of land,
we are now in the position to realise to some extent
what happened when a murder had taken place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No
galanas
for murder
within the
kindred.</div>

<p>If it was of some one within the kindred, there
was, as we have said, no slaying of the murderer.
Whether it were a parricide or a fratricide, or the
murder of a near kinsman, under Cymric custom
there was no galanas, nothing but execration and
ignominious exile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The blood
feud and
therefore
blood
fine
between
kindreds.</div>

<p>But if a tribesman of one kindred were killed by
a tribesman of another kindred, then it was a serious
matter of blood feud between the kindreds, or of the
payment of the blood fine. The tribal conscience
demanded vengeance or composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The slayer
flees to a
church
with his
cattle.</div>

<p>It sometimes happened that the murderer had fled
to a church for safety, taking his cattle with him.
For the clergy or monks at the place of refuge
had a herd of cattle of their own, and with them
the murderer’s cattle were allowed to wander and
graze so long as they returned nightly to the
refuge.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Six cows
for the
saraad
or insult.</div>

<p>There he remained presumably till the kindred of
the murdered tribesman, through negotiation and
arrangement of the chiefs of the kindreds, had agreed
to accept the payment of the galanas, if it were the
case of an uchelwr or full tribesman, of 126 cows.
Six cows, as we shall see hereafter, were <i>saraad</i> for
the insult, and 120 cows galanas for the murder.
The saraad was paid first&mdash;six cows or other cattle
to the same value belonging to the murderer were
driven from the herd in payment.</p>

<p>The murderer’s life was then safe, and presumably
he might return with his cattle to his place.</p>

<p>Within a fortnight, the tribesmen of the murderer’s
kindred met to apportion the payment of the rest.
They came from trefgordds far and near, from the
territories sometimes of various higher territorial
chieftains within whose districts they had grazing
rights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">120 cows
by fortnightly
instalments
for
galanas.</div>

<p>The collected tribesmen having apportioned the
payment, fortnight after fortnight instalments must
be paid till the whole number in value of 120 cows
was completed.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>But by whom was the payment to be made?<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
slayer’s
near
family pay
40 cows.</div>

<p>Forty cows must first be found by the <i>murderer</i>,
his <i>father</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>brothers</i>, and <i>sisters</i> with him. They
doubtless helped one another, but theoretically, in
one or other of the common herds, there must
have been cattle belonging to the murderer, his
father, mother, brothers, and sisters, or how could
they have paid their shares? There was nothing
unreal in this liability of each to pay a share, for
had the murderer been slain each one of them would
have received, instead of having to pay, a share in
40 cows.</p>

<p>The murderer himself had to pay a third of the
40 cows if he had them. His father and mother
between them paid the next third, and the brothers
and sisters the remaining third, the sisters paying
half what the brothers did.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The herds of many
a trefgordd must be thinned before this could be
done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The other
80 fall
on the
kindred.</div>

<p>The remainder of the galanas, viz. 80 cows,
fell on the kindred, to the seventh degree or fifth
cousins. The paternal relations had to find two
thirds of it and the maternal one third, and these
kindreds embraced the descendants from the great-grandparents
of the great-grandparents on both
sides.</p>

<p>In the first fortnight the kindred on the father’s
side had to find half what was due from them. In
the second fortnight they had to find the other half,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and in the third fortnight the maternal kindred had
to find their share, till so at last the full tale of the
120 cows was paid. The oath of peace from the
kindreds of the murdered man could then be given,
and the murderer and his kinsmen, be at peace.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
slayer’s
right of
‘spear
penny.’</div>

<p>But what happened if the murderer could not
find the cattle for his third of the 40 cows which he
and his immediate family had to find? He had yet
a right, as a member of the greater kindred, to claim
in aid a ‘spear penny’ from all those male kinsmen
descended from a common ancestor on his father’s
side two steps further back, <i>i.e.</i> still more distantly
related to him than those included in the kindred to
the seventh degree who had already paid their share.
Even if the slayer were a woman, she had the same
right of spear penny from the men of her kindred to
help her to make her payment.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
solidarity
of the
kindred
and individual
liability
within it.</div>

<p>So this attempt to realise what was involved in
the payment of an ordinary case of galanas brings us
back to the recognition of the double aspect of the kindred
in the structure of tribal society&mdash;its solidarity
and joint responsibility, on the one hand, as against
outsiders, the whole kindred being responsible in
the last resort; on the other hand the individual
responsibility of its members, graduated according
to nearness of relationship, for the crimes of their
relative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Each had
his <i>da</i> or
cattle for
maintenance
and
so could
contribute
to the
payment.</div>

<p>In Cymric tribal society this was made possible
by the broad fact that both males and females in the
group of kindred, on both paternal and maternal sides,
liable to pay, had cattle of their own in the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
herd, each having received his or her <i>da</i> for maintenance
by right of kin and descent from the common
ancestor or chieftain of the kindred. The two things
surely hang together. And therefore, if we find in
the laws of other tribes somewhat similar rules
regarding the payment of wergelds, it probably will be
worth while to inquire further whether the corresponding
structure of tribal society, or something
more or less equivalent to it, may not be present also.</p>

<h3>VI. THE AMOUNT OF THE CYMRIC GALANAS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The
galanas
and the
saraad
distinct
things.</div>

<p>In all the Welsh Codes the galanas, as already
mentioned, is described in a peculiar form. It is a
combination of two items, viz. the saraad, or payment
for insult, and the galanas proper.</p>

<p>Thus the galanas of the innate boneddig, or young
tribesman, accepted by the kindred as a tribesman of
nine descents of Cymric blood, is described as ‘three
kine and three score kine,’ that of the <i>uchelwr</i> or <i>breyr</i>
as ‘six kine and six score kine.’</p>

<p>The explanation of this is obtained from the
following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What is the galanas of the breyr without office? Six kine
and six score kine. The six score kine is the galanas and the
six kine is for saraad of the corpse.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So also in the Gwentian Code:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When a married man shall be murdered his saraad is first
paid and then his galanas, for the wife has the third of the saraad,
and she has no part of the galanas.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>So also in the Venedotian Code:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No one is killed without being first subjected to saraad. If a
man be married, let a third of the man’s saraad be given to his
wife and let the two shares be placed with the galanas, and after
that let the galanas be divided into three shares and let the third
share go to the lord as exacting third.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The wife
shared in
the saraad
of her
husband,
not in the
galanas.</div>

<p>The reason why the wife has a share in the
saraad and not in the galanas has already been
explained. She suffers from the personal affront or
insult to her slain husband and shares in the saraad.
But she has no blood relationship with her husband,
and only the husband’s kindred are therefore entitled
to share in the galanas, as her husband’s kindred
alone would have been concerned in the feud.</p>

<p>The saraad and the galanas were therefore separate
things and subject to separate rules, though
both payable on the murder of a tribesman. The
galanas proper is what must be regarded in any
comparison with Continental wergelds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">That of
the
‘uchelwr’
120 cows;
of the
young
tribesman
60 cows.</div>

<p>The real galanas of the uchelwr or breyr, apart
from the saraad, was 120 cows, and that of the
young innate boneddig who had received his <i>da</i> but
had no family was 60 cows. In one of the Codes
his galanas when <i>married</i> is said to be 80 cows.</p>

<p>Now in what currency was the galanas paid?
Formerly, according to the Codes, all payments were
made in cattle, and the galanas proper was reckoned
in scores of cows.</p>

<p>But of what cow? How was the normal cow for
practical purposes to be defined? It is a question
worth answering, because we may probably take
the Cymric method, of valuing the cow as a unit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
currency in cattle, as at any rate suggestive of the
methods generally adopted by other tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description
of the
normal
cow.</div>

<p>According to the Venedotian Code the cow was
of full normal value when in full milk and until her
fifth calf.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And if there be any dispute concerning her milk, she is to be
taken on the 9th day of May to a luxuriant place wherein no animal
has been before her, and the owner is to milk her without leaving
any for the calf, and put the milk in the measure vessel, and if it
be full twice a day that is sufficient; and if it be not, the deficiency
is to be compensated by oatmeal until the feast of St. Curic,
thence until the feast of St. Michael by barley meal, and from
thence until the calendar of winter by rye meal.</p>

<p>Others say that the worth of the milk deficient in the measure
is to be returned to the possessor of the cow; if half the milk be
deficient, half the worth; if a third of the milk, a third of the
worth; and that is the best mode.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then the <i>milk measure</i> is described thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The measure for her milk is, three thumbs at the bottom, six
in the middle of the vessel, and nine at the top, and nine in its
height diagonally (<i>enyhyd en amrescoeu</i>), and the thumb whereby
the vessel is to be measured (in case of dispute) is the breadth
of the judge’s thumb.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Dimetian Code substantially the same rules
are given, except that the measure of the cow’s
milking is smaller.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The measure of a vessel for a cow’s milk is nine thumbs at its
edge, and three at the bottom, and seven diagonally from the off-side
groove to the near-side edge in height.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The only difference is between the seven and the
nine thumbs of diagonal measurement. Possibly
there may be some error in the figures, and the
measure may have been the same in both Codes.</p>

<p>Returning to the galanas; although it was
reckoned in the Codes in scores of cows, a fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
equation had already been made between cows and
silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cow
reckoned
as three
‘scores’
or ounces
of silver.</div>

<p>The normal cow was equated in the Codes with
‘three scores of silver.’ And in the Latin version of
the Dimetian Code the ‘score of silver’ is translated
by ‘uncia argenti.’ The score of silver at the date of
the Code was therefore an ounce of silver. So that
the reckoning is the Frankish or Anglo-Saxon one of
twenty pence to the ounce.</p>

<p>The score of pence of 32 wheat-grains would
make the ounce of 640 wheat-grains: that is, the
ounce of the pound of 240<i>d.</i>, or 7680 wheat-grains&mdash;the
pound in use in England after the time of Kings
Offa and Alfred, and at the date of the Codes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
galanas
of the
‘uchelwr’
30 lbs. of
silver. At
a ratio
of 1:12
equal to
the gold

200 solidi.</div>

<p>The galanas of the uchelwr or breyr being 120
cows, and the cow being reckoned at three scores or
ounces of silver, the galanas would equal 360 scores
or ounces, or thirty pounds of silver.</p>

<p>The ratio of gold to silver after the temporary
disturbance under Charlemagne had, as we have seen,
settled down again to the Imperial ratio of 1:12.</p>

<p>Now thirty pounds of 7680 wheat-grains equal
230,400 wheat-grains, and this number of silver
wheat-grains divided by twelve equalled exactly
19,200 wheat-grains of gold. So that this Celtic
galanas of the Cymric uchelwr or breyr of 120 cows,
like so many Continental wergelds, was apparently
exactly equal to 200 <i>gold solidi</i> of ninety-six wheat-grains,
<i>i.e.</i> the heavy gold mina of Imperial standard.</p>

<h3>VII. THE METHODS OF TREATMENT OF STRANGERS OR
NON-TRIBESMEN.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Strangers
in blood
how
treated.</div>

<p>Another point upon which special inquiry is
made in this volume regards tribal methods of
treating strangers in blood and slaves.</p>

<p>There is no subject requiring more careful investigation
than the combination of circumstances
out of which arose what is roughly called serfdom,
<i>i.e.</i> the attachment of tenants to the land rendering
services to a lord. I shall not be suspected of
suggesting that tribal customs and methods were
the <i>sole</i> factors which produced serfdom and of
ignoring the influences which came from Roman
methods of managing landed estates, and from Roman
law modified by ecclesiastical usage.</p>

<p>Indeed, I have insisted from the first that while,
in the ‘Germania’ of Tacitus, the germs may be
found of an ‘embryo manor,’ both Roman and
German elements probably combined in producing
the later manorial system and serfdom which grew
up in what were once the Roman provinces of Gaul
and the two Germanies, and even also in Britain.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
But I think that in Cymric tribal custom we may
find a fresh clue worth following in the attempt
to gather from Continental evidence the methods
likely to be used by conquering German or Anglo-Saxon
tribes in the treatment of strangers in blood.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">After four
generations
on
the land
they
become
<i>adscripti
glebæ</i> and
obtain
recognition
of
kindred.</div>

<p>In Welsh tribal custom <i>alltuds</i> or strangers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
their descendants (not necessarily otherwise unfree
persons) having some special circumstances in their
favour, being allowed to settle within the district of
a greater or lesser chieftain upon land which, in a
sense, may have been his demesne land, were free to
remove and settle under another chieftain, unless
and until they had remained on the same land or
under the same lordship for four generations. But
thereafter the great-grandchildren of the original
settlers became <i>adscripti glebæ</i>. And this fixture to
the land, or rather to the lordship, was apparently
not looked upon as in any way a degradation in rank,
but on the contrary a step in advance towards the
recognition of tribal rights. The great-grandson of
the stranger did not indeed become a Cymric
tribesman, but he gained the recognition of his status
as the founder of a kindred of his own, the members
of which in after-generations would, as kinsmen, be
able to swear for and defend one another.</p>

<p>This being so in the case of free strangers coming
into the country, the next question is what was the
position of the semi-servile class, the <i>aillts</i> and <i>taeogs</i>
of the Codes, who and whose ancestors for many
generations had been born upon the land in a semi-servile
condition?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
rights
increase
with
growth of
kindred.</div>

<p>The fixture to the land of the aillt or taeog was
not the special mark so much of a semi-servile
condition as of his <i>want of recognised kindred</i>, and
under the local custom of South Wales it seems that
he too, like the alltud, could sometimes arrive at the
recognition of kindred, without indeed becoming a
Cymric tribesman, at the end of four generations of
residence under the chieftain of the land; and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to further recognition of it, involving a still better
position as to rights, at the ninth generation. The
ninth man in South Wales seems according to local
custom in some districts to have, at last, climbed the
highest rung of the ladder, and to have attained the
right to claim the status of a Cymric tribesman.</p>

<p>This curious rise under Cymric custom, by steps of
four generations, up the ladder towards the recognition
of tribal rights, seems to have a suggestive
correspondence with the reverse process under
manorial usage of proving the serfdom of a <i>nativus</i>
by showing that the great-grandfather was a <i>nativus</i>
on the lord’s land, the manorial rule being that
settlement on servile land for four generations made
the posterity of an original settler into <i>nativi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of
kindred
the key
to their
position.</div>

<p>Once more let us try to realise what this meant,
and what was the position of these Cymric non-tribesmen
in regard to their settlement on land.</p>

<p>If under the guidance of the Codes we turn to
the extents and surveys, we find them living, in
some cases, not mixed up with the tribesmen, but in
separate groups, or trefs, or trefgordds. There may
be here and there exceptional alltuds or strangers of
a higher class growing up, by the gradual process of
intermarriage for four generations with tribeswomen,
into the status of tribesmen. But the mass of the
stranger class were aillts and taeogs living in separate
<i>taeog trefs</i>, though, according to the surveys, sharing,
often in common, certain rights of grazing over
certain districts with gwelys of tribesmen. Now
these groups of taeogs and aillts were, according to
the Codes, as we have seen, of two classes, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
recognise the same two classes when we find in the
surveys not only groups of taeogs in taeog-trefs but
also gwelys of non-tribesmen.</p>

<p>The normal group of the taeog-tref differed from
the free tref in the fact that in it no family rights
were recognised. All the members of it shared in its
rights and payments equally <i>per capita</i>, and not <i>per
stirpes</i>. They were all liable as a body, few or many,
for the whole amount of the dues to the chieftains.
During their fathers’ lifetime sons shared <i>pari passu</i>
and equally with their parents, and other members
of the group, in the pasture and common ploughing,
except youngest sons, who remained with their
fathers.</p>

<p>In the gwelys, on the other hand, as in the gwelys
of tribesmen, there was recognition of family or blood
relationships, and a patriarchal element.</p>

<p>There were thus under Cymric tribal custom
various subordinate grades or classes. Beginning at
the bottom of the ladder were:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The slaves who could be bought and sold,
and who were reckoned as worth one pound of silver.</p>

<p>(2) The taeogs and aillts or permanent <i>nativi</i>,
born non-tribesmen, without recognised family rights.</p>

<p>(3) Non-tribesmen growing or having grown in
four generations into gwelys of non-tribesmen with
recognised family rights.</p>

<p>(4) Strangers of exceptional position who, having
married into the tribe, had become tribesmen in the
fourth generation by repeated intermarriage.</p>

<p>And once more the fact should never be lost sight
of, that the gradual growth into tribal or quasi-tribal
rights was not a growth into exactly what in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
modern sense would be called individual freedom.
It was accompanied by the growth of ties which
bound the family to the chieftain, till at the moment
that at the fourth generation the recognition of
rights of kindred was attained, the family found
itself, as we have seen, so closely tied to the chieftain
and the land that the newly recognised gwely had
become <i>adscriptus glebæ</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, the tribal logic of the case was probably
something like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
stranger
a kinless
man who
has no
protection
but from
his lord
till a kindred
has
grown up
around
him.</div>

<p>The free tribesman is the man who belongs to a
kindred who can protect him by oath and by sword.
Until a stranger has kinsmen who can do this he is
an odd or kinless man, protected only by his lord.
If he be killed his galanas goes to his lord; he has no
recognised kin to receive it. If, on the other hand,
he is charged with slaying another, he has no kin to
swear to his innocence, the oath of a non-tribesman
not being held good as against a tribesman. If
guilty, he has no kin bound to fight in the feud for
him, or to help him to pay a galanas for his crime.
So that even when at the fourth generation the
descendant of the alltud becomes the founder of a
gwely he has gained only half the status of a tribesman.
It is not till the fourth generation of descendants in
the gwely, <i>i.e.</i> the seventh generation from the original
settler, that a complete kindred has grown up. It
is not till then that the descendant of the original
alltud is surrounded by a full group of relatives,
born in his great-grandfather’s gwely, whose oaths
can be taken and who can protect him by oath and
sword or in payment of galanas. All this time the
alltud family have been more or less dependent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the protection of the chieftain, and rights and
obligations are apt to be correlative.</p>

<p>The object of this essay is to inquire how far, in
the case of other tribes, evidence may be found of
the working of somewhat similar tribal instincts,
resulting in customary rules more or less like those
of the Cymry, so that at last, turning attention to
the Anglo-Saxon laws, we may be able all the more
fully to recognise and appreciate in them the traits
of tribal custom, which among other factors went
to the making of Anglo-Saxon England.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for future reference, the following
list of the galanas of various classes will be found
convenient:&mdash;</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE EVIDENCE OF BEOWULF ON TRIBAL CUSTOM
REGULATING FEUDS &amp;c.</i></span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">What
were the
laws of
the blood
feud?</div>

<p>The object of the short study, in this chapter, of
<i>Beowulf</i>, is to learn what incidental information it
may give of tribal usage regarding the <i>blood feud</i>,
especially on points which, in the case of the substituted
wergeld, present doubt and difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to some of these
points. Did the rule excluding galanas or blood-fine
within the kindred extend beyond the gwely to the
greater kindred? What happened to a tribesman in
a feud between his paternal and maternal kindreds?
Did he abstain from taking sides, or did a marriage
so far unite two families or kindreds as to make them
one for the purpose of blood-fine or feud, so as to
prevent the feud or blood-fine from arising?</p>

<p>These are questions upon which we want light
from the point of view of Welsh tribal custom, and
upon which we approach Beowulf for light, with
eyes open also to other matters of tribal usage as
they may turn up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An 8th
century
story of
blood
feuds.</div>

<p>Beowulf for the present purpose may be taken as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
an Anglian or Northumbrian recension of a story
founded upon Scandinavian tradition, and designed
for use or recital at some 8th century royal court&mdash;possibly,
if Professor Earle’s suggestion be correct,
that of King Offa.</p>

<p>The western horizon of the story extends to the
Frisian shores, but the scene seems chiefly to lie in
the Baltic.</p>

<p>The plot involves tribal relations between a
chieftain of the Danes possibly of Zealand, and
two Swedish chieftains. The two latter concern us
most, and they seem to be the chiefs of two kindreds&mdash;Geats
and Swedes&mdash;Beowulf himself being the link
between them, his mother having married from one
into the other kindred. This marriage at any rate
was one <i>between</i> two kindreds.</p>

<p>There is no apparent effort on the part of the
poet to enlighten the reader or those who heard him
either upon the pedigrees of the persons mentioned
in his story or upon the rules of Scandinavian tribal
custom. But it happens that, by incidental hints
dropped in the telling of the tale, the pedigree of
each of the kindreds involved can be fairly made
out, and has already been made out by translators
and critics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">involving
blood
feuds
between
Beowulf’s
paternal
and
maternal
kindred.</div>

<p>And as the story involves a homicide within
Beowulf’s maternal kindred, and fighting and bloodshed
between the kindreds in spite of the marriage
link, and as it deals also with outside feuds, it
happens to present remarkable opportunities for
studying the action of tribal custom in various
cases.</p>

<p>The evidence it gives is made all the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
valuable by its being an Anglian version of Scandinavian
traditions, inasmuch as the poet, or his
Anglian interpreter, assumes throughout that the
laws of the game, under Scandinavian tribal custom,
were too well known to need explanation to his
Anglian audience. So that by inference it would
seem that the customs of Baltic chieftains were familiar
at the court of Offa, and not very far removed from
those of Anglian tradition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Scyldings.</div>

<p>The poet introduces us first to a tribe of <i>Gar-Danes</i>
and the clan or kindred of Scyldings. Scyld
the son of Scef is the ancestor of the Scyldings. He
is an Adeling who has torn their meadthrones from
many tribes (mægdum) and in true tribal fashion
compelled them to pay tribute. Surrounded in his
old age by numerous descendants and other <i>gesiths</i>
who have resorted to him, the chieftain has become a
great hero in his tribe (mægdh).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The burial
of Scyld
by his
‘gesiths.’</div>

<p>A graphic description of the burial of Scyld in
his ships by his gesiths is a fitting introduction to
the poem. Let us mark in passing that the word
mægd evidently may mean a much wider kindred
than the near family of a great-grandfather’s descendants
(the Welsh gwely). One mægd conquers
another and makes it pay tribute.</p>

<p>Again the word gesith evidently includes, with
members of the near kin, such others, not necessarily
blood relations, as may have joined the warrior band
of the hero. They may or may not have been
adopted into his kindred in becoming his men, but
this extension of comradeship or kinship, as the case
may be, to these gesiths adds to the greatness and
power of his mægd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hrothgar
the great-grandson
of Scyld.</div>

<p>The opening episode of the burial of Scyld is
followed by a few lines which reveal something of
the pedigree of his descendant Hrothgar the
Scylding. The pedigree of Hrothgar, in true tribal
fashion, makes Scyld his great-grandfather. He is
‘Hrothgar the Scylding,’ may we not say, <i>because</i>
Scyld was his great-grandfather, just as Hengist and
Horsa were <i>Oiscings</i> according to Bede, who in
stating their pedigree makes <i>Oisc</i> their great-grandfather,
and just as in the Welsh surveys the gwelys
still bear the great-grandfather’s name though he be
long dead, because the gwely hangs together till the
fourth generation.</p>

<p>So far as it goes here is at least an indication that
the nearer kindred (or gwely) might be much the
same thing both in Celtic and Teutonic tribes.</p>

<p>But Hrothgar is not described only as chieftain
of his nearer kindred. Success in arms had made
him head of many <i>winemâgas</i> (blood friends) and
he was surrounded by a mighty <i>mago-dright</i> (band
of kin). He had built himself a famous <i>folk-stede</i>,
or hall, called ‘Heort,’ and all had gone well
with him till the monster Grendel came upon the
scene.</p>

<p>The deliverer from the monster was Beowulf,
the hero of the story. He comes from another
kindred, that of the Scylfings, whose pedigree, not
fully given, seems to have been something like the
following.</p>

<p>Scylf was the common ancestor of the Swedes or
Scylfings. The tribe was divided into two families
in the elder of which descended the chieftainship of
the Scylfings (2382).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beowulf

and
so a Wægmunding.</div>

<p>At any rate the Scylfings seem to be divided into
two families whose common ancestor was Scylf.
But both Beowulf and Wiglaf are spoken of as
<i>Wægmundings</i> (2608 and 2815). The headship of
the Scylfings had passed into the older of the two
families (2384), and this probably is the reason why
Beowulf is never called Beowulf the Scylfing.</p>

<p>The reason why Beowulf appeared as the natural
helper of Hrothgar from the monster Grendel was
that his father Ecgtheow owed a debt of gratitude to
Hrothgar. ‘Fighting out a mighty feud,’ Ecgtheow
had killed Heatholaf the Wylfing (460), thereby
raising another feud. Wherefore his own people (463)
fearing invasion, had caused him to flee over sea,
thereby seemingly wiping their hands of him. He
seems to have fled to Hrothgar just as the latter had
become chieftain of the Scyldings on his brother
Heorogar’s death. Hrothgar compounded the feud
with money (470), sending to the Wylfings over sea
‘ancient treasures.’ Whereupon Ecgtheow swore
oath to Hrothgar and presumably became his ‘man.’
And Beowulf now, ‘at honour’s call,’ had come to
fight the monster, thereby confirming the friendship
between Geats and Gar-Danes, requiting what
Hrothgar had done for his father (459).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Beowulf
a thane
of his
maternal
uncle
Hygelac.</div>

<p>The details of the fight need not detain us. But
the fact is important that Beowulf comes to the
rescue not as a Scylfing or as representing his
paternal kindred, but as the thane of his maternal
uncle Hygelac, the chieftain of his mother’s kindred.</p>

<p>He approaches Hrothgar with a band of fifteen
chosen warriors. When asked from whence they
came they said they were Geats, Hygelac’s <i>hearthgeneats</i>
(260). And the meaning of the word is
illustrated further when the warriors accustomed to
sleep in Hrothgar’s hall are spoken of as Hrothgar’s
<i>hearthgeneats</i> (1581, and see 260 and 2419). When
brought into the hall Beowulf himself calls his band
Hygelac’s <i>beod-geneats</i> (344) (table geneats), and to
Hrothgar he calls himself ‘mæg and mago-thegn,’
literally ‘kin and son thane’ of Hygelac (408).</p>

<p>The daring deed accomplished, Beowulf’s success
is rewarded by many golden and other gifts from
Hrothgar, and it is significant that on his return he
lays all these at the feet of his maternal uncle
Hygelac, his <i>heofodmagus</i>&mdash;chief of kin&mdash;whose man
and kin he owns himself to be. His position in
Hygelac’s kindred thus demands careful study.</p>

<p>This seems to be the pedigree.</p>

</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Homicide
within the
family unavenged.</div>

<p>Beowulf is made to say that, when seven winters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
old, Hrethel had received him from his father Ecgtheow
and had kept him as his own child (2420). ‘Remembering
kinship’ (sippe gemunde), the old chieftain
held him in no less regard than his own three sons,
Herebeald, Hæthcyn, and Hygelac. But Hrethel’s old
age was full of trouble. The worst tragedy that
came upon him was the death of his eldest son Herebeald,
killed by his second son apparently by accident.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Hæthcyn by arrow from hornbow brought him (Herebeald)
down, his near kinsman. He missed the target and shot his
brother. (2440)</p>

</div>

<p>Here, then, was an apparently accidental homicide
within the family. How was it regarded?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>One brother killed the other with bloody dart. That was a
wrong past compensation.… Any way and every way it was
inevitable that the Etheling must quit life unavenged. (2445).</p>

</div>

<p>The poet likens the father’s grief to that of ‘an
old ceorle’ who should see his young son ride on the
gallows-tree and can do nothing but wait while his
son thus hangs, food for the ravens, as he cannot
bring him help (2450).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>So did the crowned chief of the Stormfolk, in memory of
Herebeald, carry about a tumult of heart-sorrow. He could not
possibly requite the feud upon the man-slayer, neverthemore
could he pursue the warrior with hostile deeds though not beloved
by him. He then, with the sorrow wherewith that wound had
stricken him, let go life’s joys and chose the light of God. (2464.)</p>

</div>

<p>Thus incidentally is revealed by the poet the depth
of the tribal feeling that homicide can only be atoned
for by avengement and feud, making it a hard
struggle against nature for a father to withhold
revenge upon a son for even accidental fratricide.
As with the Cymry, it seems that there could be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
feud or composition within the family. Nor in the
case of accidental homicide was there apparently in
the poet’s mind the necessity of flight or outlawry,
however great the craving for avengement. It is
also significant that Hæthcyn, the slayer, is made to
join with his brother Hygelac in the next warfare
after Hrethel’s death (2474). The accidental slayer
remains a tribesman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quarrel
between
Beowulf’s
paternal
and
maternal
kindred.
He takes
no part
in it.</div>

<p>This next warfare was a quarrel&mdash;‘provocation
and reprisal’&mdash;between Swedes and Geats, <i>i.e.</i> between
the paternal and maternal kindreds of Beowulf. He
himself, it is worth noting, did not engage in it. Onela
and Ohthere, the sons of Ongentheow (Beowulf’s
paternal relation and chief of the Scylfings or Swedes),
apparently began the quarrel. They recklessly broke
the peace between the two families&mdash;Swedes and
Geats. Hrethel was no longer living. Beowulf’s
maternal uncles, Hæthcyn and Hygelac, fought on one
side, and Ongentheow and his two sons on the other
(2485). Hæthcyn fell on one side and Ongentheow on
the other: the latter by the hand of Eofor&mdash;a
comrade rather than kinsman of Hygelac, for he was
rewarded by the bestowal of Hygelac’s daughter.
The quarrel seems to have been open fighting,
possibly from the revival of the old enmities and in
breach of tribal custom. Be this as it may, Beowulf
himself took no part in the quarrel between his
maternal and paternal kindreds.</p>

<p>This disastrous and unnatural quarrel left Hygelac
the only surviving son of Hrethel, and so the chieftain
of Beowulf’s maternal kindred.</p>

<p>All this irregular fighting, incidentally mentioned
by the poet, was past before Beowulf’s great enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
against the monster Grendel. And, as we have
seen, it was as the ‘man and kin’ of Hygelac that
Beowulf appeared at Hrothgar’s court. And it was
at the feet of Hygelac as his chief of kin, and at the
feet of Hygd his queen, that Beowulf laid down his
treasures on his return in safety. This exploit ended,
Hrothgar thenceforth disappears from the poem, and
the poet confines himself to Beowulf’s nearer
belongings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But in
feud with
Frisians
Beowulf
fights for
Hygelac,
who is
killed.</div>

<p>The next event in order of date is a quarrel between
Hygelac and the Frisians. This time Beowulf
fights for his chieftain. But Hygelac is killed (2357),
and again the result reveals interesting traits of tribal
custom.</p>

<p>Beowulf returns from Friesland to Hygd the
widowed queen of Hygelac. She ‘offers him rings
and throne, not daring to trust that her young son
Heardred would be able to maintain the chieftainship
against all stranger folk.’ Beowulf, however,
declines to become <i>hlaford</i> over Heardred, but
supports him in his chieftainship till he should be
older (2370).</p>

<p>Young Heardred, however, is not chieftain long
(2380). The old lawless quarrel between Beowulf’s
maternal and paternal relations rises up again.</p>

<p>The facts, when unravelled, seem to be these:&mdash;Within
Beowulf’s paternal kindred trouble had arisen.
For some cause not told, the grandsons of Ongentheow
(sons of Ohthere) had been outlawed. They are
described as wräc-mäegas (2380) and as having cast
off allegiance to the chieftain of the Scylfings. These
outlawed kinsmen of Beowulf’s paternal family came
to young Heardred’s court, and whilst his guests (‘on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
feorme’) the young chieftain fell by the sword of
one of them (2388).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homicide
within the
kindred
again
is unavenged,
though
Beowulf is
guardian
of the
slain.</div>

<p>It was Eanmund by whom this outrage was
committed, and once more the crime remained apparently
unavenged. The slayer was allowed to
withdraw in safety, leaving Beowulf to succeed to
the chieftainship of his maternal kindred (2390).
Again we ask why? Here was a crime committed by
an outlawed paternal kinsman of Beowulf against the
chieftain of his maternal kindred, of whom he was
himself the guardian, and yet Beowulf did not avenge
it! Was it because of the kinship, or because of the
outlawry? Whilst nursing the remembrance of his
chieftain’s death, Beowulf is made to act with
kindness to the other outlawed brother in his
desolation, waiting for such avengement as might
come at last in the course of things&mdash;as it did,
according to the poet, when ‘with a band of warriors
over sea Eadgils died in cold and painful marches’
(2396).</p>

<div class="sidenote">An
outlawed
tribesman
not
protected
by his
kindred.</div>

<p>Avengement is made to follow too in the same
way upon Eanmund the murderer. It came from
Beowulf’s paternal uncle, Weohstan. But here again
the poet is careful to record that it came not in
a blood feud, but ‘in fair fight’ with weapon’s
edge (2612). And, as if to emphasise the fact that
the outlawed kinsman had forfeited all tribal rights,
the poet adds that ‘Weohstan from his kindred
carried off the armour and sword of Eanmund,
Onela (Eanmund’s uncle) yielding them up to him
<i>without a word about a feud</i>, although he (Weohstan)
had slain his brother’s son’ (2620).</p>

<p>Evidently the poet means to make it clear that
Onela’s passive attitude was due to the fact that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nephew was a lawless exile, and so no longer entitled
to protection from his kin (2612 and 2380).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The old sword known among men as the relic of Eanmund
(son of Ohthere), whom, when a lawless exile, Weohstan had slain
in fair fight with weapon’s edge; and from his kindred (magum)
had carried off the brown mottled helmet, ringed byrnie, and old
mysterious sword; which Onela yielded up to him, his nephew’s
war-harness, accoutrement complete. Not a word spake he
(Onela) about the feud, although he (Weohstan) had killed his
brother’s son. He (Weohstan) retained the spoils for many a
year, bill and byrnie, until when his own boy (Wiglaf) was able
to claim Eorlscip rank, like his father before him, then gave he to
him, before the Geats, armour untold of every sort, after which he
gave up life, ripe for the parting journey.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the restrained desire of avengement incidentally
is made to find satisfaction at last as regards
both the outlawed sons of Ohthere.</p>

<p>After these events the elder branch of the Scyldings
passes out of the poet’s interest. The only remaining
heroes of the tale are the two Wægmundings&mdash;Beowulf
and Wiglaf.</p>

<p>A long interval had elapsed between Beowulf’s
accession to the chieftainship of his maternal kindred
and the final feat of daring which cost him his life.
And it was Wiglaf, his nearest paternal kinsman,
who in the last tragedy came to his aid bearing the
sword of the outlawed Eanmund. Beowulf’s dying
words to Wiglaf were: ‘Thou art the last left of
our kindred (cynnes) the Wægmundings. Fate has
swept into eternity all my kinsmen (mâgas)&mdash;eorls
among men! I must after them!’ As he comes to
the rescue, Wiglaf remembers the honour done to
him by Beowulf, who had already passed on to him
the hereditary right of the chieftainship of the
Wægmundings (2608).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beowulf
as ‘sister’s
son’
becomes
chief
of his
maternal
kindred.</div>

<p>Why had he done this? If we might tentatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
use the clue given by ancient Greek tribal custom to
elucidate a Scandinavian case, we should say that on
failure of male succession the ‘sister’s son’ of Hygelac
had been called back into his mother’s kindred to
become its chieftain, leaving Wiglaf, his next of kin
on his father’s side, to sustain the chieftainship of his
paternal kindred. The right of the maternal uncle,
known to have existed under early Greek law, to
claim his ‘sister’s son’ if need arose, to perpetuate
the mother’s paternal kindred, suggests a similar
explanation in Beowulf’s case. Such a right, found
as well in the Laws of Manu, may possibly have been
inherent in Scandinavian tribal custom also. Such a
suggestion would be at least consistent with the fact
of Beowulf’s having been brought up from seven
years old in the household of his maternal grandfather,
and treated by him as a son. It would be in
harmony, too, with what Tacitus describes to have
been the relation of the ‘sister’s son’ to the <i>avunculus</i>
amongst the German tribes, and the peculiar value of
the ‘sister’s son’ as a hostage.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Some indirect confirmation of the probable truth
of such a suggestion may perhaps be also drawn from
the fact that in Beowulf, when a man’s father is no
longer living, the poet sometimes seems to describe
him as his maternal uncle’s nephew instead of as his
father’s son.</p>

<p>Heardred, the young son of Hygelac and Hygd
his queen, after his father’s death is spoken of no
longer as Hygelac’s son, but as the <i>nephew of Hereric</i>,
‘nefan Hererices’ (2207). Now his paternal uncles
were Herebeald and Hæthcyn, and it becomes an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
almost necessary inference that Hereric was a maternal
uncle. Thus:</p>

<div class="beowulf">

<p class="pre">
                  <span class="smcap">Hæreth</span> (1929)

          |                        |

                                (2207)
</p>

</div>

<p>So also in the case of Hygelac himself. He was
the son of Hrethel. The poet calls him son of
Hrethel (1486), and again <i>Hygelac Hrethling</i> (1924).
But after Hrethel’s death he calls him ‘Hygelac of
the Geats, <i>nephew of Swerting</i>’ (‘<i>Hygelac Geáta nefa
Swertinges</i>’) (1204). Here again it seems likely that
Swerting was the maternal uncle, though the poet, as
in the other case, does not think it needful to explain
that it was so. Otherwise, why the change of
epithet?</p>

<p>We are here recording tribal customs as revealed
in Beowulf, and not seeking for their origin in earlier
stages of tribal life. We pass on, therefore, to

<p>It is with the chieftains’ grade of rank that we
have mostly to do in Beowulf, and nothing is more
strongly emphasised by the poet than the important
place of marriage between two tribes or kindreds as
a link, recognised, however, to be a very brittle one,
binding them together so as to end or prevent the
recurrence of a feud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>When Beowulf, after his first exploit in aid of
Hrothgar against Grendel, has returned to his
maternal uncle and chief of kindred Hygelac, and is
recounting his adventures, the poet at the first mention
of Hrothgar’s queen makes him call her the
‘peace bond to the people.’ And in the same breath,
in telling how in Hrothgar’s hall the daughter Freaware
bore the ale-flagon, he stops to tell how that
‘she, the young, the gold dight, was promised to the
gay son of Froda; it having pleased the Friend of
the Scylfings that he, through that woman, should
compose deadly enmities and feuds.’ And the poet
makes Beowulf moralise to the effect:&mdash;‘Often and
not seldom anywhere after deadly strife, it is but a
little while that the baneful spear reposes, good
though the bride may be!’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marriage
a link
between
kindreds.</div>

<p>It would seem that Hrothgar had been formerly
at feud with the Heathobeards, that Froda had been
killed in the feud, and that the marriage of Freaware
to Froda’s son, Ingeld, was to close the feud.
But Beowulf repeats aside to Hygelac that he does
not think much of the chances of a long continuance
of peace between Scyldings and Heathobeards (2030).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Well may it mislike the ruler of the Heathobeards and every
thane of that people when the lady goeth into hall with a prince
born of Danes, amidst the high company; upon him do glisten
heirlooms of their ancestors, ringed harness, once Heathobeardic
treasure, while they could keep the mastery of those weapons and
until they in an unlucky moment led to that buckler play their
dear comrades and their own lives. Then saith one over the
beer, one who observes them both, an old lance fighter.… ‘Canst
thou, my friend, recognise the blade, the precious steel, which thy
father carried into battle, wearing his helmet for the last time,
where the Danes slew him? … and the masters of the battlefield
were the fiery Scyldings! Now here a boy of one of those
banesmen walketh our hall … wearing the treasure which by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
right should have been thine!’ So urged and egged on at every
turn with galling words, at last the moment comes that for his
father’s deeds the lady’s thane sleepeth bloodspattered after the
falchion’s bite, life-doomed! The other escapes alive! By-and-by
the sworn oaths of the warriors on either side will be broken,
when in Ingeld’s mind rankle war purposes, and care has lessened
his domestic sorrow! Therefore I deem not the loyalty of the
Heathobeards nor the alliance with the Danes secure, or the
friendship firm! (2033-2069, slightly abridged.)</p>

</div>

<p>What a consistent light this passage throws
incidentally on the quarrels which, in spite of the
Geats and Swedes being bound together in friendship
by the marriage of Beowulf’s mother, broke out again
and again, according to the poem, between the two
kindreds&mdash;quarrels in which Beowulf himself is
represented as taking no part, presumably because,
according to tribal custom, his blood relationship to
both kindreds was a bar to his taking up the feud
or assuming the part of the avenger! And how the
whole story of Beowulf’s paternal kindred reveals the
melancholy fact that, however great the force of
tribal custom in controlling feuds, the wild human
nature of hot-blooded tribesmen was wont to break
through restraints and often ended in the outlawry of
tribesmen and the breaking up of kindreds!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary
of the evidence
of
Beowulf.</div>

<p>To sum up the results obtained from the study of
tribal custom as incidentally revealed in Beowulf:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) There is no feud within the kindred when one
kinsman slays another. However strong the natural
instinct for avengement, it must be left to fate and
natural causes. Accidental homicide does not seem
to be followed even by exile. But murder within
the kindred breaks the tribal tie and is followed by
outlawry.</p>

<p>(2) Marriage between two kindreds is a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
though precarious means of closing feuds between
them. The son of such a marriage takes no part in
a quarrel between his paternal and maternal relations.</p>

<p>(3) When a marriage takes place, the wife does
not pass entirely out of her own kindred into her
husband’s. Her own kindred, her father and brothers,
maintain a sort of guardianship over her, and the son
in some sense belongs to both kindreds. He may
have to join in his maternal kindred’s feuds, and he
may become the chieftain of his maternal kindred on
failure of direct male succession, even though by so
doing he may have to relinquish the right of chieftainship
in his paternal kindred to another kinsman.</p>

<p>Finally, in passing from the blood feuds to the
composition substituted for them, after what we have
learned from Beowulf of tribal custom, there need be
no surprise that maternal as well as paternal relations
are found to be interested in them. We may fairly
judge that tribal custom, in the stage in which we find
it in Beowulf and later in the laws of various tribes,
would not have been true to itself, had this been
otherwise.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>TRIBAL CUSTOM OF THE IRISH TRIBES.</i></span></h2>

<h3>I. THE ERIC FINE OF THE BREHON LAWS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Goidelic
tribal
custom
differed
from
Cymric.</div>

<p>Returning now once more to the examination of
tribal custom and the structure of tribal society in
the case of tribes belonging to the Celtic group, it
might be expected that Cymric customs would be
likely most closely to accord with those of the Celtic
tribes of Ireland, Brittany, and Gaul. But it
must be remembered that the Cymry whose customs
are contained in the Codes, whatever their original
Continental position may have been, are supposed to
have come into Wales from the North, with Cunedda
and his sons. The Codes therefore probably represent
the customs of the Cymry of ancient Cumbria
north of the Solway Frith, rather than those of the
Britons, whether Goidels or Cymry, dwelling in
South Wales and more or less subject for generations
to Roman rule.</p>

<p>If the theory of the emigration from Wales and
Cornwall into Brittany, as the consequence of the
Saxon invasion, be correct, the Britons who emigrated
into Brittany may never have shared the peculiar
customs of the immigrants into Wales following upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the conquests of Cunedda and his sons. They may
have had more in common with the Goidelic tribes
of South Wales than with the Cymric newcomers
into Wales.</p>

<p>These considerations may well prepare the way
for the recognition of differences as well as resemblances
between Cymric and Irish tribal custom.</p>

<p>The system of payments for homicide amongst the
ancient tribes of Ireland as described in the Brehon
Laws differed widely from that of the Cymric
Codes.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>In the first place, the Brehon laws describe no
scale of galanas or wergeld, directly varying with
the social rank of the person killed. Gradations
of rank there were indeed, and numerous enough.
But there appears to have been only one <i>coirp-dire</i>,
or body-fine, the same for all ranks, namely seven
cumhals or female slaves&mdash;the equivalent of twenty-one
cows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Brehon
<i>coirp-dire</i>
of all
tribesmen
the same:
six
cumhals
and one
added.</div>

<p>And when this <i>coirp-dire</i>, or price of the body or
life of a man, is further examined, it is found to consist
of two parts: (1) one cumhal of compensation
(aithgin); (2) the six cumhals of the <i>coirp-dire</i> proper.</p>

<p>In the tract ‘Of every Crime’<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> it is stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the man who is dead has a son, he takes the cumhal of
compensation alone. If not alive, his father is to take it. If not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
alive, his brother; if he be not alive, the nearest person to him is
to take it. And then the coirp-dire is divided:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 cumhals to the son and the father;</li>
<li>1 cumhal to the brother;</li>
<li>1 cumhal to the son and father (<i>sic</i>);</li>
<li>1 to the geilfine from the lowest to the uppermost man;</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;so making up the 6 cumhals of the coirp-dire.</p>

</div>

<p>And in the ‘Book of Aicill’ (p. 537) are these
lines:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Three eric fines are counselled:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) There is paid full compensation;</li>
<li>(2) And fair honest coirp-dire;</li>
<li>(3) And honour-price is paid.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>eneclann</i>
or honour-price
varied
with rank.
The ‘eric’
fine included
both.</div>

<p>Besides this coirp-dire, therefore, was the <i>eneclann</i>,
honour-price or price of the face, <i>i.e.</i> payment for
insult. And this was the payment, by no means confined
to homicide, which varied according to rank.</p>

<p>These two things then&mdash;the coirp-dire of seven cumhals
and the honour-price&mdash;made up together (with,
in some cases, exceptional additions) the eric fine.</p>

<p>Next as to the persons liable for its payment.</p>

<p>In the Corus Bescna<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> the following statement is
made relating to homicide in cases where the homicide
was one of <i>necessity</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The eric fine is to be paid by the slayer’s kindred (fine), as
they divide his property (cro). He (the slayer) shall pay a
cumhal of restitution (aithgin) and as much as a son or a father
of the six cumhals of the dire-fine.</p>

</div>

<p>As to crimes of <i>non-necessity</i>:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">he himself is to be given up for it, with his cattle and his land.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
kindred
of ‘near
hearths’
were liable
for the
whole eric.</div>

<p>If he has not enough to pay the eric or is not to
be caught, then</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">it is to be paid by his son until his cattle and his land be spent
on it (or failing him) by his father in the same manner.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, failing both the son and the father,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">it is to be paid by each nearest hearth (teallach) to him until all
they have is spent, or full payment of the crime is made up
among them.</p>

</div>

<p>So that, in the absence or in default of the
murderer, at the date of this Brehon tract, his family
and kindred were answerable for the whole of the
eric in the case of wilful murder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
‘hearths’
liable

to third

<p>The nearest hearths or ‘fine who bear the crimes
of each kinsman of their stock’ were, according to the
Senchus Mor (i. p. 261):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<li>1. <i>Geil</i> fine;</li>
<li>2. <i>Derb</i> fine;</li>
<li>3. <i>Iar</i> fine;</li>
<li>4. <i>Ind</i> fine.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>I think M. D’Arbois de Jubainville<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> is probably
right in explaining these four hearths or fines to be
groups or grades of kindred. He divides them thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whether this interpretation of the Brehon scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the divisions of the Irish fine or kindred be
correct in every detail I shall not venture to give an
opinion, further than to say that, viewed in the light
of other tribal systems, it seems to me to be nearer
the mark than the various other attempts to make
intelligible what after all are very obscure passages
in the Brehon Laws. The seventeen persons making
up the four divisions of the fine or kindred must be
taken, I think, as representing <i>classes</i> of relations and
not individuals; <i>e.g.</i> under the head ‘first cousin’
must be included all ‘first cousins,’ and so on
throughout.</p>

<p>So understood, the four hearths or groups of kindred
liable for the eric would include the sixteen grades
nearest of kin to the criminal. He himself, or the chieftain,
would form the seventeenth person on the list.</p>

<p>The tract ‘Of every Crime’ seems to confirm the
view above taken. It states (iv. 241) that ‘for the
crimes of every criminal’ he himself was first liable.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If he has absconded it goes upon his chattels; living chattels
or dead chattels.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The four
‘fines’ or
‘hearths’
were
groups of
kinsmen
in grades
of relationship.</div>

<p>The liability falls next upon his father and his
brother, but, according to the commentary, upon his
son first, if he have one. These seem to be the
<i>geilfine</i> relations or nearest hearth. And after them
it falls, according to the text, upon his ‘deirbhfine
relations.’ And ‘if they have absconded so that
they cannot be caught, his crime goes upon his chief.’
But before it goes upon the chief the iarfine and
other fines come in, according to the commentary,
and the <i>chief</i> is said to be that of the <i>four fines</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The reason why the crime goes upon the deirbhfine division
and the iarfine division here before it goes upon the chief is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
because it is one chief over them.… <i>His chief</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the chief
of the four families (p. 243).</p>

</div>

<p>On the whole, therefore, according to whatever
rules of kinship a fine may have been divided into
the ‘four nearest fines or hearths,’ we can hardly be
wrong in considering them not as four artificial
groups including in all seventeen individuals, but as
four <i>family groups</i> arranged in the order in which
liability for a kinsman’s crime was to be shared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The same
groups
both
received
and paid
eric.</div>

<p>The full liability for the eric would then, as in
the Cymric case, fall upon the four groups or hearths
as a whole. But, again as in the Cymric case, the
amount falling upon each of them was defined
and divided among the individuals composing it.
The same family division held good both as regards
payment and receipt of eric.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The general correspondence between the obligation
to pay and the right to receive a share in
fines is shown by another passage from the Senchus
Mor:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The feini charge the liability of each kinsman [comfogius] upon
the other in the same way as he obtained his eric fine and his
inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The penalties for any other crime than homicide
fell in the first instance upon the criminal alone, and
the person injured took the whole of the compensation
for his injury.</p>

<p>But it was not so in the case of homicide. It was
not a matter for the individual alone. Both in payment
and receipt it was, as with the Cymry, a joint
interest of the kindred.</p>

<p>The following passage makes this clear:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What is the reason that it is upon himself alone every crime
that a person commits goes, <i>except killing</i>, provided he has the
means of paying it?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Because, though it be against him alone evil is done,
<i>except killing</i>, it is to himself alone it shall be paid. Every
<i>killing</i>, however, which he commits, it is not he alone that shall
pay for, though he has the means of paying for it, but it goes
upon the family (fine), and this is now the reason: because though
it were himself or his son that had been killed, it is the whole
family (fine) that would take the body fine (coirp-dire) of either
of them, and not his son or father.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
solidarity
of the
kindred.</div>

<p>A still clearer indication of this solidarity of the
family or kindred occurs in the Book of Aicill (p. 541)
in regard to the right of the several members,
according to relationship, to share in composition for
a kinswoman abducted without their consent. If
taken without her own consent, honour-price was to be
paid to herself, and also honour-price was to be paid
to her chiefs, and her relations, according to the
nature of their relationship to her. This presumably
was for the breach of their protection. Should death
overtake her before she was restored, coirp-dire and
honour-price were to be paid to her family. In case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of her consent it was the same except that she could
claim no honour-price for herself.</p>

<p>So far, then, we have felt our way to the following
conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary
of the
rules as
to eric.</div>

<p>(1) That the eric for homicide in Ireland was
shared by the family in grades of relationship
elaborately fixed, but which it is not necessary to
discuss further.</p>

<p>(2) In cases of innocent homicide the family, <i>i.e.</i>
four nearest hearths or grades of kindred, shared the
eric with the slayer, <i>i.e.</i> the slayer was only liable to
pay a share of the eric.</p>

<p>(3) In cases of intentional homicide the goods of
the murderer all had to go first, and only the
remainder was thrown upon his kindred. But (except
<i>inter se</i>) they were liable to the kindred of the slain
for the whole of what the slayer could not pay.</p>

<p>(4) The eric consisted of two parts&mdash;the coirp-dire
and the honour-price. The coirp-dire was seven
cumhals, one of which was for restitution (<i>aithgin</i>),
the other six cumhals being the <i>coirp-dire</i> proper.</p>

<p>(5) As in other laws, there were sometimes
additional payments for breach of protection or
privilege &amp;c.</p>

<h3>II. THE HONOUR-PRICE (ENECLANN).</h3>

<p>It is necessary next to direct special attention to
the honour-price (eneclann).</p>

<p>The question at once arises, <i>whose</i> honour-price
had to be paid?</p>

<p>In the first place, according to a passage in the
Book of Aicill, it is the honour-price of the <i>slayer</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that had to be paid, <i>i.e.</i> the higher the rank of the
slayer the greater the payment to the kindred of the
person slain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
honour-price
of
the slayer.</div>

<p>The passage alluded to occurs almost at the
beginning of the Book of Aicill (p. 99). The heading,
literally translated, is: ‘Fines are doubled by anger
(ferg).’ Then follows a long commentary, in which
the point seems to be limited to <i>secret</i> murder, and the
doubling seems to be the result of the <i>concealment</i>. This
is quite consistent with tribal feeling as shown in
other laws, concealment of the slain person on the
part of the murderer being considered a grave aggravation.
The passage is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Fines are doubled by anger (ferg).</i></p>

<p>The double of <i>his own honour-price</i> is due of each and every
person, whether native freeman, stranger, foreigner, daerman, or
looker-on, for the crime of <i>secret</i> murder.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And then the commentary goes on to say that if
it was the same person who killed and concealed</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">a fine of 7 cumhals and full honour-price for the concealing, and
7 cumhals and full honour-price for the killing, which is twice
7 cumhals and double honour-price upon a native freeman for
secret murder.</p>

</div>

<p>Obviously the <i>honour-price</i> in both cases is that of
the murderer, for a little further on is a statement that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">the same fine is upon a native freeman for looking on at the
killing of a native freeman, or a stranger, or a foreigner, or a
daerman.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
honour-price
of
the slain
or of his
kinsmen.</div>

<p>But besides this honour-price of the criminal, as
we have seen, other payments had apparently to be
made to the relatives of the slain, for breach of their
protection or for injury sustained, and these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
measured by the honour-price of the recipients and
not by that of the criminal.</p>

<p>It is not quite clearly stated that these payments
were a part of the eric, but we may suppose that
they were in a sense a buying off of the right of feud,
and accepted in lieu of the right of joining in the
avengement of the crime and in the feud, for which
the eric was the composition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
honour-price
of
the protector
of
the slain.</div>

<p>A passage in the Book of Aicill (p. 107) incidentally
seems to show that the son of a person slain
could choose whether to claim honour-price on the
scale of his own social rank, according to right of property,
or of the status of his father or grandfather, or
that of the chieftain under whose protection he lived.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If, having been given his choice of taking honour-price in
right of property, or honour-price in right of his father and his
grandfather, he made choice of honour-price in right of his
property, and decay came upon his property so that he has [left]
but the kingship of the three handles&mdash;the handle of his flail, the
handle of his hatchet, and the handle of his wood axe; he is
(then) entitled to but one screpall for his worthiness if he be
worthy; and if he be not worthy he is entitled to nothing, unless
children have been born to him afterwards which he had not
before on the day of making his choice, and if they have been
born he has honour-price in right of them.</p>

</div>

<p>The passage goes on to mention the case of his
having made choice ‘to have honour-price in right of
his relations or in right of his chief.’</p>

<p>In the Senchus Mor (i. p. 275), without direct
mention of the case of homicide, is the following
statement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The honour-price is fourfold. Full honour-price is due to one
for his father, half honour-price for his father’s brother, one third
honour-price for his son or his daughter, one fourth honour-price
for his grandson.</p>

</div>

<p>On the whole it may be gathered from the Brehon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
tracts that, whilst the coirp-dire or body fine was a
fixed amount, the eric or full payment was complex,
involving, besides the coirp-dire, the honour-price of
the slayer according to his rank, and also payments
to the relations of the slain, regulated by their honour-price
and rank, and nearness of relationship to the
slain person, by way of reparation for the insult or
injury involved, or for breach of their protection, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In order to judge how much these payments of
honour-price added to the eric, we must seek to learn
something of the character of the various grades and
ranks, and the amount of the honour-price of each.</p>

<h3>III. THE GRADATIONS IN RANK UNDER THE
BREHON LAWS.</h3>

<p>The gradations in the honour-price, as stated in
the ‘Crith Gabhlach,’ become very important from
the light thrown by them upon the structure of
tribal society in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
‘midboth’
or ordinary
freeman
and
his food
allowance.</div>

<p>At the bottom of the list of these grades is
mentioned the <i>midboth</i> man or ordinary freeman
without land or cows (?). He is said to be entitled, as
food allowance, to the humblest fare of ‘milk and
stirabout’ and for himself alone (iv. 301).</p>

<p>His honour-price is only a dairt heifer or colpach
heifer, and his honour-price (as that of other grades)
is also the limit of the value of his oath or pledge.
He is a man who has not yet attained to a household
of his own. When he has done that he seems to rise
to the next rank of an <i>og-aire</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a young <i>aire</i>.</p>

<p>Suddenly, we are told of the og-aire that he has
seven cows and a bull, seven pigs, seven sheep, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a horse. He also has a cow land, <i>i.e.</i> land to graze
seven cows, for which a cow is paid every year by
him to his chief. He has an ox, and a fourth part of
the needful for ploughing: <i>i.e.</i> presumably he joins
with others in making up a plough team of four
oxen. Surely these have been supplied to him by
his chief, as in the case of the Cymric ‘da.’ His
proportionate stock (turcreicc) is eight cows, which
with his land he gets from a bo-aire, possessed of
surplus cattle, and he pays to him a food-rent ‘bes
tigi’ (like the Welsh gwestva) of a cow and a pig,
&amp;c. Should his stock increase he does not always
become at once a <i>bo-aire</i>, ‘because four or five such
may occupy the land of a bo-aire, and it would not
be easy for each of them to be a bo-aire’ (iv. pp.
305-309).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
‘bo-aire.’</div>

<p>So in the same way a <i>bo-aire</i> has land of twice
seven cumhals, and he has half of a full ploughing
apparatus, and his proportionate stock (from his
chief) is twelve cows; and a colpach heifer is his
food-rent; and his honour-price is five seds.</p>

<p>A bo-aire may have a full and complete plough
team and twenty cows and other things, and he may
even rise to the giving of proportionate stock to
tenants of his own if his stock should have grown too
much for his land. But he still may remain a bo-aire.
He may, however, rise from a bo-aire into a <i>flaith</i> (or
chief), when he has double as much as an ‘aire desa’
and has established himself with a <i>green</i> round his
homestead, and so surrounded his house with a <i>precinct</i>
in which he can give protection to cattle taken
in distress, this being one of the important duties
and functions of a chief (flaith) (iv. pp. 309-317).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem that even when a man had risen to
be the chief of his kindred (fine) he might still be
simply a bo-aire, and not necessarily yet a <i>flaith chief</i>.</p>

<p>In another tract, among other disconnected items
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whatever number of the divisions of the bo-aires happen to
be contending, though one of them be older than the others, the
grade which is most wealthy, <i>i.e.</i> in point of wealth, it is it that
takes precedence.</p>

<p>He is a hill of chieftainship in the third person.</p>

<p>Unless his father and grandfather were flaith, though he may
be of the same race as to his origin, his chieftainship is lost to
him.</p>

<p>A plebeian chief is one whose father or grandfather was not a
chief (flaith). (iv. pp. 379-381.)</p>

</div>

<p>It would seem from these statements that to
become a flaith from the rank of bo-aires something
like an election was needful, and that wealth weighed
most in the election. It shows, however, that it was
election out of a class or family in which the flaithship
descended from father to son, and that one of the
qualifications was that a man’s father and grandfather
before him must have been flaiths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘aire
desa.’</div>

<p>So too in the ‘Crith Gabhlach’ (iv. p. 321) the
<i>aire desa</i> must be the son of an aire and the grandson
of an aire. He has (probably a minimum of) ten
tenants, five <i>giallna</i> and five <i>saer</i>, and gets a food-rent
from each. But he himself takes proportionate
stock from his chief, for which he pays food-rent in
the same way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘aire
ard.’</div>

<p>The <i>aire ard</i> has twenty tenants, ten <i>giallna</i> and
ten <i>saer</i>, and in his turn he takes proportionate stock
from his chief (iv. p. 325).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘aire
tuisi.’</div>

<p>The <i>aire tuisi</i> has twenty-seven tenants, fifteen
giallna and twelve saer, and he takes himself proportionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
stock from a king, ‘and he makes corus-arrangements
<i>in the raith right of his father and
grandfather</i>,’ whatever this may be (iv. 325).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘aire
forgaill.’ The ‘Ri-tuaithe.’</div>

<p>Above him is the <i>aire forgaill</i>, with forty tenants;
and at the head of the flaith or chieftain grade comes
the <i>Ri-tuaithe</i>, who is the chief or King of a Tuath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lower
grades take
stock from
the higher
and pay
food-rents
to them.</div>

<p>We need not attempt to discuss the details of
this hierarchy of chieftains. It is enough that,
throughout, the lower chieftain takes stock from and
pays food-rents to the higher chieftain, or the Ri-tuaithe,
as the case may be. So that the grades of
tribal rank were connected by the link formed by
the receipt of an allotment of stock from, and the
payment of food-rent to, the next superior grade.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Concentrating attention now on the ‘fine’ or
group dependent upon a single flaith or chief, we
have seen that it consisted not only of his kindred,
but also of other dependents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The other
tenants of
a chieftain.</div>

<p>We have seen that the chief had both <i>giallna</i> and
<i>saer</i> tenants, and that he supplied these tenants with
stock, and received food-rent and services in return.</p>

<p>In the second volume of the Senchus Mor<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> are two
chapters on <i>Saer-raith</i> and <i>Daer-raith</i>. And the two
kinds of tenancy are explained somewhat as follows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
continuance
of
tenancy
for three
lives.</div>

<p>In the <i>saer</i>-raith the stock is given without any
pledge, and the return for it is one-third in value
as food-rent every year, and the tenant has to perform
what is translated as homage, and to do service
on the dun-fort, at harvest time, and on military
expeditions, but he does no manual labour. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
saer tenant cannot separate from his own hereditary
tribal chieftain, or refuse to take stock from him,
and to that extent he seems to be <i>adscriptus glebæ</i>.
But if he chooses to receive stock from another
chief he can give it up when he likes, unless not
having returned it <i>for three lifetimes</i>, he has let the
chief get a permanent hold on him, but this must not
be so as to rob his own tribe of their innate rights
(p. 219). This freedom to take stock from other
chieftains does not, therefore, seem to alter his position
or that of his successor as permanent tenants
of their own hereditary chieftain. And this applies
both to his higher chieftain of <i>kingly</i> rank, and his
own lesser chieftain of <i>flaith</i> rank.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He cannot separate from his own king (ri) at any time, either
in <i>saer</i>-rath or <i>daer</i>-rath, unless the chief be indigent.… His
own <i>aire</i> of the <i>flaith</i> grade is in the same position as his own
<i>king</i> (p. 211).</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, whilst in the case of stock
taken from another chieftain the contract can be
ended on either side (except after three lives), the
hereditary king or chieftain cannot, without good
reason, withdraw the stock from the tenants.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If he be his own king he can never take away either his <i>saer</i>
stock or <i>daer</i> stock unless the tenant be indigent, and there are
no life separations between the tenant and his own hereditary
king unless either of them act illegally, &amp;c.…</p>

</div>

<p>The tightness of the tribal bond is shown still
more clearly by the statement that the chieftain
himself is not competent to forgive, so as to bind his
successors, the food-rent due from the tenant.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The food-rent is free to the successors of the chief; for the
chief is not competent to forgive the payment of what supplies his
house (p. 213).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>So much we gather from the chapter on <i>saer</i>-rath.
Now as to <i>daer</i>-rath (p. 223). No one was bound to
take <i>daer</i> stock from any one, not even from his own
chieftain or king. Taking daer stock was therefore
a matter of contract, and a contract by a tribesman
affected his <i>fine</i> or kindred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The stock is received by the tenant either with or without
the knowledge of the <i>fine</i>, for if it was unknown to them they
could impugn his contract, but if it was within their knowledge,
though the stock be ever so great, it is fastened upon them.</p>

</div>

<p>The fine had a voice, presumably lest it should be
found that cattle in their family herd, unknown to
them, might belong to some outside chieftain. And
further, if continued for three lives, the obligation
might become permanent, as in the case of saer stock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Fuidhir’
tenants
become
<i>adscripti
glebæ</i>
after three
generations.</div>

<p>Besides these <i>daer</i> and <i>saer</i> tenants who had
taken stock from their chieftain or king, and who
seem to have been to a great extent <i>adscripti glebæ</i>,
there is mention of <i>fuidhir</i> tenants. They seem to be
strangers, admitted, like the Cymric alltuds, upon a
chieftain’s land, and, like the Cymric alltuds, free to
move away, until by residence for three generations
they also have become recognised as freemen, and
at the same time <i>adscripti glebæ</i>.</p>

<p>In the tract, ‘Divisions of the Tribe of a Territory,’<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
is the following mention of the fuidhir
tenants, confirming what has been said above.</p>

<p>It occurs in the commentary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>His fuidhir tenants, <i>i.e.</i> they become free during the time of
three persons; the fourth man is called a daer-bothach person;
the <i>fifth is a sencleithe</i> person.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The fifth person would be the great-great-grandson
of the original fuidhir. Further on (p. 287) is
the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The families of the fuidhir tenants are subject to manifold
divisions. The son is enriched in the same ratio as his father,
and the father does not sell anything to the prejudice of his sons,
grandsons, great-grandsons, or great-great-grandsons.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The fifth
generation
become
‘sencleithe.’</div>

<p>The chief point of interest is that the men of the
fourth generation of fuidhirs, according to the above-quoted
passages, became <i>daer-bothach</i> persons&mdash;half
free men&mdash;and the fifth generation <i>sencleithe</i>, so that
the family, like the Cymric stranger, grew into freedom
in four or five generations.</p>

<p>This gradual growth of fuidhirs into sencleithe
tenants in five generations of occupation is illustrated
by the retention of rights for a corresponding period.
In the Book of Aicill (p. 157) is a statement that the
land of an imbecile person (a fool’s land) is not lost
to his descendants, though they be also imbeciles,
‘till five persons:’ that is, till the fifth generation.</p>

<p>The number of generations required does not,
however, seem to have been absolutely uniform.</p>

<p>The following is from the ‘Crith Gabhlach’
(p. 321):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If there be service from them (cottier and fuidhir tenants
which he, the chief, brings upon the land) to ‘flaith’ chiefs to
nine times nine (years?), they are cottiers and fuidhir tenants;
they are <i>sencleithe</i> tenants from that out.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Editor’s note (p. 350) to the sequel to the
‘Crith Gabhlach,’ there is a statement that the sencleithe
tenant was a man who came from his natural
chief to settle under another chief; and if he or his
successors continued away during the time of three
successive chiefs, with the knowledge of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
chief, and unclaimed by him or his successors, he or
they then became ‘sencleithe,’ and could not go away
of themselves nor be claimed by the other.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparison
with
Cymric
custom
as to
strangers,
and as to
the link
between
chief and
tribesmen
made by
bestowal
and acceptance
of cattle.</div>

<p>These passages, taken together, seem to imply that
after five, or sometimes three, generations of tenancy
under the same chieftain or his successors, the fuidhir
tenants became in some sense <i>adscripti glebæ</i>, like
the Cymric alltuds, and at the same time formed a
group of kindred very much like a Cymric gwely.</p>

<p>Beyond this it is not easy to realise the position
of the <i>sencleithe</i> person. The text of the Brehon law
tracts is often very obscure, and the commentary so
imperfect that the suggestion again and again occurs
to the student that the commentator may sometimes
himself be groping in the dark. Moreover, all the
Brehon tracts have not yet been published, so that
we have as yet only part of the evidence before us.
Still it seems to be safe to say that there are indications
that, as in Wales, there were rungs in the social
ladder by which the stranger or unfree tenant might,
after a certain number of generations, climb into
something like freedom and tribal rights at the cost
of becoming at the same time attached to the land
of the chieftain; and that to the freeman also the
grades of social rank were in some measure dependent
upon the social position of fathers and grandfathers
and great-grandfathers as well as upon the acceptance
of stock and the payment of food-rent and the performance
of services to chieftains of higher rank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, without pressing too far resemblances
which are not complete between Irish and Cymric
custom, it may at least be suggested that the Irish
example of the acceptance of stock by the young
og-aire from the chief of his family, or some higher
chieftain whose man he was or became, may throw
some light upon the Cymric provision of <i>da</i> or cattle
to the young tribesman who became ‘man and kin’
to the chieftain who gave it for his maintenance. In
the Irish instance, this bestowal and acceptance
of stock was part of a system which ran through
all ranks and grades. And it seems to have formed
the natural link connecting one social rank with
another, and securing some kind of solidarity in
the whole kindred or tribe, in addition to the tie
of blood relationship and sometimes as a substitute
for it.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to consider the amount
of the honour-price of the various grades in tribal
society as exhibited in the Brehon tracts, and to
judge how far it was an important addition to the
coirp-dire, and whether it raised the Irish <i>eric</i> to an
amount at all near to that of the <i>galanas</i> of the
Cymric Codes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>The honour-price is given in the ‘Crith Gabhlach’
in seds. The number of cumhals or female slaves is
taken from a list in the Book of Aicill (p. 475) and
from a statement in the Senchus Mor (i. p. 76) in
which the honour-price of the aire forgaill is stated
to be 6 cumhals.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the honour-price of the Ri-tuaith,
the highest chieftain, was seven cumhals,
whilst the honour-price of the bo-aire only amounted
to one cumhal, that of the og-aire to only three
two-year-old heifers, whilst that of the simple freeman
without land or cattle was only one single heifer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difference
between
the Irish
‘eric’ and
the
Cymric
‘galanas.’</div>

<p>The whole eric fine for homicide, including the
coirp-dire and additional payments of honour price,
evidently fell very far short of that of the Cymric
galanas. Even in the case of the Ri-tuaith or highest
chieftain slain by one of his own rank, the eric can
hardly have exceeded the galanas of the young unmarried
Cymric tribesman&mdash;viz. of sixty cows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
honour-price
the
limit of
the power
of protection.</div>

<p>The importance under Irish tribal custom of the
honour-price of a tribesman, and its graduation in
proportion to rank, position, and wealth in the tribe,
is apparent quite apart from the question of homicide.
It ruled the value of ‘his oath, of his guarantee, of
his pledge, and of his evidence.’ These according to
the ‘Crith Gabhlach’ (p. 307) were the four things in
which he acted to the extent of his honour-price, and
he was not competent to undertake liabilities beyond
this limit. This becomes very important when we
realise how large a place the system of compurgation,
or the support of a kinsman by the oaths of his
fellow-kinsmen, filled in tribal usage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, whilst the honour-price of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
tribesman or chieftain was the limit up to which his
power of giving protection to his fellow-tribesmen by
oath or pledge or otherwise extended, it also was
the measure of his own protection. He was entitled
to his honour-price not only in case of homicide. If
he was satirised or insulted, or if the protection he
afforded to others was violated, or his house was
burned, or any one stole from him, out of his house or
in it, or forced his wife or his daughter, his honour-price
was the measure of the amount of redress he
could claim for the wrong. The analogy of this to
the Cymric <i>saraad</i> is obvious, and something like it
is found in most tribal systems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A typical
case of
eric from
the
Senchus
Mor.</div>

<p>Finally, imperfect and vague in some points as
may be the result of the foregoing examination of the
Irish evidence, we are now perhaps in a position to
appreciate, for what it is worth, the curious case
described in the Senchus Mor.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It may be taken so
far as it goes as a precedent or indication of the way
in which the intricate matters connected with the
eric fine and honour-price were worked out in practice,
though it is difficult to explain all the rulings of
the Brehon experts.</p>

<p>The matter in dispute was between two of the
three principal races of Erin&mdash;the Feini or ‘men of
the North’ and the Ulaidh or ‘men of the South.’
Fergus was the son of the King of the Ulaidh.
Owing to a quarrel amongst the Feini, Eochaidh
Belbhuidhe, being expelled by Conn of the Hundred
Battles, had fled from his own tribe and put himself
under the protection of Fergus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst under the protection of Fergus, Eochaidh
was killed by Asal the son of Conn, and by four sons
of Buidhe, and a grandson of Buidhe. The latter,
being the son of Buidhe’s daughter <i>Dorn</i> by a
stranger, was not acknowledged by her kindred
(fine).</p>

<p>The eric fine for this outrage upon the protection
of Fergus was thus arranged:&mdash;He was to have three
times seven cumhals, <i>i.e.</i> seven cumhals in gold, seven
in silver, and land of seven cumhals called <i>Inbher-Ailbhine</i>.</p>

<p>This was in satisfaction for the crime of the six
murderers, viz. the son of Conn, and the four sons and
the grandson of Buidhe. Five out of the six slayers
apparently were able to pay their share. But not so
the sixth, viz. the grandson of Buidhe, the illegitimate
son of his daughter Dorn, who, being unrecognised
by the kindred, apparently had no claim for help
from them. Consequently Dorn, the mother of the
illegitimate grandson, was handed over to Fergus as a
bondwoman in pledge for her son’s share of the eric.</p>

<p>So matters stood for a time. But a new trouble
arose, which seems to have upset the whole settlement
and made it necessary to consider it over again,
from the beginning.</p>

<p>It would seem that after all there was a question
whether the land <i>Inbher-Ailbhine</i> was permanently
handed over, or only for a time, and redeemable
within the period of the lives of three chieftains,
because there was a question whether such a period
had expired or not. And again it was claimed that
Dorn was only given in <i>temporary</i> bondage as a pledge
for her illegitimate son’s share of the eric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these doubts, new circumstances had
created a new position. Fergus was unfortunate
enough to have suffered a blemish on his face. This,
being a serious matter in a chieftain, was studiously
kept from his knowledge. Dorn, acting as bondwoman,
was one day, according to the story, preparing
a bath for Fergus. Fergus complained that she was
too slow about it and struck her with his horse-whip.
She, being vexed, reproached him with his
blemish, and for this insult Fergus slew her on
the spot. Very shortly afterwards Fergus himself
died.</p>

<p>This then was the new position, causing a new
quarrel between the two tribes and involving the
reopening of the old one. The interest lies in the
way in which it was settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Final
balance
of payments
agreed to.</div>

<p>A balance was now struck between the crimes on
each side, beginning with the slaying of Eochaidh
while under the protection of Fergus, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Fergus, being king of a province, was entitled to 18 cumhals
both as airer-fine and honour-price for the violation of his protection.
There were also due to him 9 cumhals for his half airer-fine
and half honour-price for Dorn’s insult in reproaching him
with the blemish; so that this was altogether 27 cumhals to Fergus.</p>

</div>

<p>On the other side the Feini claimed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Honour-price was demanded by the Feini for the killing of
(Dorn) the pledge, for the pledge they had given was without
limitation of time, and for it 23 cumhals were payable by Fergus
for airer-fine and honour-price, for the authority of Fergus was
opposed at the time.</p>

</div>

<p>This seems to have settled the matter between the
two tribes; <i>i.e.</i>, so to speak, the public matter between
the Feini and Fergus’s people. But there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
individual rights to be considered also. Besides these
23 cumhals due to his tribe,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Buidhe was entitled to honour-price for the killing of his
daughter, <i>i.e.</i> he was an <i>aire-forgaill</i> of the middle rank and was
entitled to 6 cumhals as honour-price. Her brother was also
entitled to honour-price for her death; he was an <i>aire-ard</i> and
was entitled to 4 cumhals as his honour-price.</p>

</div>

<p>Why the other brother had no claim for honour-price
does not appear&mdash;perhaps the one brother was
the representative of the brothers as a class. The
total sum demanded on Dorn’s side was therefore
23 + 6 + 4 cumhals = 33 cumhals.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>So that this which the men of the South demanded amounted
to 33 cumhals, and the men of the North demanded 27; and a
balance was struck between them, and it was found that an
excess of 6 cumhals was due by the men of the North, for which
the land <i>Inbher-Debhline</i> was again restored by the men of the
North.</p>

</div>

<p>The commentary goes on to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And it is evident from this, that when a man has paid eric
fine, should the person to whom it has been paid commit a crime
against him, the law orders that his own eric fine should be
restored to the former should it be better than the other eric fine.</p>

</div>

<p>In this case the land which had been taken by
Fergus as ‘seven cumhals of land’ was returned to
pay for the balance due of six cumhals only.</p>

<p>It will be observed that whilst the father and
brother of Dorn had their own honour-price allowed
for her slaying, no <i>coirp-dire</i> was claimed for the life
of Dorn herself. The reason is given as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What is the reason that the land was restored by the people
of the North and that the eric-fine for the woman was not restored,
whereas both had been given (to Fergus) as eric-fine for trespass?
The reason is the woman committed an offence in the North
for which she was forfeited, and the land did not commit any
offence for which it could be forfeited, but it was returned in part
payment for that trespass (<i>i.e.</i> the killing of Dorn).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV. THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THE BREHON FINES
WERE PAID.</h3>

<p>Before leaving the Irish coirp-dire and honour-price,
allusion must be made to the currency in
which they were paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Payment
in cumhals
or
female
slaves.</div>

<p>The most significant point was the payment in
<i>cumhals</i> or female slaves. The cumhal was equated
with three cows, but the payment was reckoned and
stated in cumhals. The female slave was the prominent
customary unit of payment, and doubtless a
common object of commerce and trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cumhal =
three cows
or ounces
of silver.</div>

<p>The equation of the cumhal and the cow with
silver was also remarkable. The cow was equated with
the Roman ounce, and the cumhal with three ounces.</p>

<p>From a passage in the Senchus Mor (i. p. 247)
and the Book of Aicill (pp. 371-377), the following
table of values is evolved:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Comparative values">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">8</td>
    <td>wheat-grains</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>= pinginn of silver</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">24</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td>(3 pinginns)</td>
    <td>= screpall</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">72</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td>(3 screpalls)</td>
    <td>= sheep (B. of A. p. 377)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">96</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td>(4 screpalls)</td>
    <td>= dairt heifer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">576</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td>(6 dairts)</td>
    <td>= bo, or cow, or unga</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">1728</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td>(3 bo)</td>
    <td>= cumhal or female slave</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These silver values as compared with those of the
Cymric Codes seem at first sight to be singularly
low. The Welsh cow, as we have seen, was valued in
silver at three Saxon ounces, and the male and
female slave each at a pound of twelve ounces. The
Welsh value of the cow was roughly three times,
and that of the slave three and one third times, the
Irish silver value.</p>

<p>This Irish equation between cattle and silver
must surely have been made at a time when silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was of quite exceptional value in Ireland. But
there is some reason to believe that an earlier
equation had been made with gold of a very different
character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An older
equation
with gold.</div>

<p>Professor Ridgeway has called attention to an
interesting story from the life of St. Finian in the
Book of Lismore (fol. 24, b.c.), in which an ounce of
gold was required for the liberation of a captive, and a
ring of gold weighing an ounce was accordingly given.</p>

<p>Now, if the ounce of gold is put in the place of
the cumhal or female slave, the gold values of the
Brehon monetary reckonings would be:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Comparative values">
  <tr>
    <td>Cumhal</td>
    <td>=</td>
    <td class="tdr">576</td>
    <td>wheat-grains</td>
    <td>=</td>
    <td>ounce</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bo or cow</td>
    <td>=</td>
    <td class="tdr">192</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td>=</td>
    <td>stater or ox unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dairt heifer</td>
    <td>=</td>
    <td class="tdr">32</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td>=</td>
    <td>tremissis</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These gold values, if established, would take their
place at once as following the gold system of
Constantine, and probably might belong therefore
to a period in which the Continental ratio of
gold to silver would be 1:12, and the silver values
fairly consistent with those of the Welsh and other
tribes. The cumhal or female slave would then
equal twelve ounces or one pound of silver as in
Wales. This, however, must not be taken as proved.
It is with the silver values of the Brehon Laws that
we are here concerned. And we should be tempted
to refer this silver value to the period of Charlemagne’s
attempted introduction of the ratio of 1:4 were it not
that, as we shall see, it seems to date back to a period
some centuries earlier.</p>

<p>There is another point of interest in connection
with the early Irish monetary reckoning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
reckoning
in scores
of Roman
ounces,
<i>i.e.</i> the
‘Mina
Italica.’</div>

<p>We have seen that in the Brehon Laws the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
smallest silver unit was the <i>screapall</i> or scripulum.
And it has already been mentioned that the scripulum
was also known as the <i>denarius Gallicus</i>, of which
24 went to the Roman ounce of 576 wheat-grains,
as in the Brehon Laws, and that a score of
ounces made the mina Italica of twice 5760 wheat-grains.
It is curious to find in a passage quoted by
Petrie<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> from the <i>Fodla Feibe</i> in the Book of
Ballymote,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> a full and exact appreciation of the
number of wheat-grains in the scripulum and the
Roman ounce. The wheat-grains, according to this
passage, are to be taken from wheat grown on
typically rich soil which produces ‘the three
roots,’ and 24 wheat-grains are the weight of the
‘screapall’ of silver, and 576 the weight of the
‘uinge’ or ounce. Further it is stated that the full
weight which the <i>Tinde</i> or weighing bar is to weigh
is&mdash;not a pound: there is no mention of the pound&mdash;but
<i>seven score ounces</i>.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Now this reckoning, not in
pounds, but in <i>scores of ounces</i>, has already been
alluded to as, consciously or unconsciously, a reckoning
in so many of the <i>mina Italica</i>. Petrie quotes a
passage from the ‘Annals of the Four Masters’ in
which this payment in scores is illustrated.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A.D. 1029. Amlaff, son of Sitric, lord of the Danes, was
captured by Mahon O’Riagain, lord of Bregia, who exacted 1,200
cows as his ransom, together with seven score British horses and
three score ounces of gold and the sword of Carlus … and three
score ounces of white silver as his fetter ounces, and four score
cows for word and supplication, and four hostages to O’Riagain
himself as a security for peace and the full value of the life of the
third hostage.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart, however, from the monetary system of the
Brehon Laws, the fact remains that the real currency
of early Irish custom seems to have been in <i>cumhals</i>
or <i>female slaves</i>. The coirp-dire and the honour-price
of the Brehon tracts were reckoned in cumhals,
and we shall find that there appears to be good
evidence that both payment in female slaves and the
equation of the female slave with three Roman ounces
of silver go back to a very early period.</p>

<h3>V. THE IRISH COIRP-DIRE AND HONOUR-PRICE TRACED
FURTHER BACK THAN THE BREHON LAWS.</h3>

<p>The evidence regarding the coirp-dire of the
Brehon Laws and its payment in female slaves does
not rest on those laws alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St.
Patrick’s
‘pretium
hominis’
of ‘seven
ancillæ.’</div>

<p>St. Patrick, in his ‘Confessions,’<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> treats the <i>pretium
hominis</i> as a well-known unit of value. These are
the words of St. Patrick:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Vos autem experti estis quantum
erogavi illis qui judicabant
per omnes regiones quas ego
frequentius visitabam; censeo
enim non minimum quam pretium
quindecim hominum distribui illis.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">You know by experience how
much I have paid out to those
who were judges in all the regions
which I have often visited; for I
think that I have given away to
them not less than the <i>pretium
quindecim hominum</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Further, in the ‘Tripartite Life’ St. Patrick is
represented as putting the alternative between the
death of a transgressor and the payment of seven
cumhals (‘<i>Aut reum morti aut <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillas reddere
debet</i>’).<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The evidence for this coirp dire and its
payment in ancillæ seems to be thrown back by these
passages to the fifth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of the
‘Canones
Hibernenses.’</div>

<p>Further, when we turn to the series of ‘Canones
Hibernenses’ published in Wasserschleben’s work,
<i>Die Bussordnungen der abendländischen Kirche</i> (p.
136), we find repeated evidence that the ‘pretium
hominis,’ or ‘pretium sanguinis,’ of seven ancillæ,
was a well-recognised unit of payment in ecclesiastical
quarters more or less connected with the
Irish and Breton Churches.</p>

<p>The first group of these Canons is headed ‘<i>De
disputatione Hybernensis Sinodi et Gregori Nasaseni
sermo de innumerabilibus peccatis incipit</i>.’</p>

<p>The first clause of this group imposes a penance
for parricide of fourteen years in bread and water
and satisfaction; or half this only if there was no
intention.</p>

<p>The next clause imposes for ordinary homicide
seven years’ penance in bread and water.</p>

<p>Clauses 8 and 10 fix the ‘prætium animæ’ of
a pregnant woman (including woman and child) at
twelve ancillæ.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ancilla</i>
of same
value in
silver as
the
Brehon
<i>cumhal</i>.</div>

<p>Clause 9 fixes for us the silver value of the
<i>ancilla</i> and seems to show that it was the same as the
silver value of the cumhal in the Brehon Laws.</p>

<p>The clause is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>XII. Altilia<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> vel XIII. sicli (? XII.) prætium uniuscujusque
ancillæ.</p>

</div>

<p>Ecclesiastical usage retained to some extent the
use of Roman phraseology. The siclus or sicilicus, as
we have already seen, was the didrachma of two
Roman <i>argentei</i> or silver drachmæ. And as the
drachma after Nero was one eighth of the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
ounce, so the <i>siclus</i> was one quarter. The Altilia
was the ‘fattened heifer’ possibly of Irish custom.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Twelve fattened heifers or sicli equalled therefore
three Roman ounces&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the exact silver value of
the cumhal of the Brehon Laws. Here, therefore,
in these so-called Irish Canons the ancilla seems to
be reckoned at the Brehon silver value of the
cumhal.</p>

<p>Having gained this point we proceed to examine
the other clauses.</p>

<p>In title III., headed ‘<i>Synodus Hibernensis decrevit</i>,’
are the following:<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seven
ancillæ
the price
of a man’s
life.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Sanguis episcopi vel excelsi
principis vel scribæ qui ad terram
effunditur, si colirio indiguerit,
eum, qui effuderit, sapientes crucifigi
judicant, vel <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillas
reddat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">The blood of a bishop or high
prince or a scribe poured on the
ground, <i>si colirio indiguerit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the
‘sapientes’ judge that he who
sheds it shall be crucified or pay
seven ancillæ.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Here, obviously, the <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ are the price of
the life of the criminal&mdash;the seven cumhals of the
coirp-dire. The canon adds the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si in specie, tertiam partem
de argento et comparem verticis
de auro latitudinem nec non et
similem oculi de gemma pretiosa
magnitudine reddat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If paid in specie, one third must
be paid in silver, and of gold of the
size of the crown of the head, and
also the like in precious stone of
the size of an eye.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>These passages seem to have a curious correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
with the following passage in the Brehon
Laws (sequel to the ‘Crith Grabhlach,’ iv. p. 363):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As to the shedding of a bishop’s blood, if it reaches to the
ground as blood that requires a tent the guilty person is to be
hanged for it, or it is seven cumhals that are to be paid for his
sick maintenance and his eric.</p>

<p>If the wound be in his face, the breadth of his face of silver is
paid, and of the crown of his head of gold.</p>

</div>

<p>The canons go on to state that if the blood does
not reach the ground <i>nec colirio indigeat</i> the hand of
the striker is to be cut off, or the half of <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ
paid, if the act is done with intention; if not, the
price of one ancilla is to be paid.</p>

<p>Another clause states that if a bishop be struck or
violently handled, without effusion of blood, half the
price of <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ is to be paid.</p>

<p>In all these cases the fines are reckoned in a unit
of <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ or the half of it. The cutting off of
the hand of the criminal is reckoned as equal to half
of <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ. The <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ is the recognised
unit.</p>

<p>When, in other clauses, dealing with the case of
the same things done to a <i>priest</i>, a lesser punishment
is decreed, still <i>the price of <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ</i> is the
price of the life of the criminal. If the blood of a
priest is shed and reaches the ground, <i>donec colorium
subfert</i>, the hand of the criminal is to be cut off, or
half of <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ to be paid, if the act be intentional.
If not intentional, the price of one ancilla is
enough.</p>

<p>In title IV., <i>Dejectione</i>, after a clause stating that
he who ejects a poor man kills him, and he who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
meets a person ready to perish and does not succour
him kills him, there follows this clause:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si quis jecerit episcopum et si
mortuus fuerit, accipiatur ab eo
pretium sanguinis ejus L. ancillas
reddit, id est <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillas uniuscujusque
gradus vel l. annis peniteat
et ex his accipiuntur <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span>
ancille de jectione ejus.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If any one ejects a bishop and
if he should be dead, let there be
received for him the price of his
blood, let him render fifty ancillæ,
<i>i.e.</i> seven ancillæ for each grade of

and from these shall be received
seven ancillæ <i>de jectione ejus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">‘Pretium
sanguinis’
seven
ancillæ.</div>

<p>Here the ordinary ‘<i>pretium sanguinis</i>’ or <i>coirp-dire</i>
is again clearly reckoned at <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> ancillæ, and the
bishop, being of the seventh grade of rank in the
ecclesiastical hierarchy, is to be paid for sevenfold.</p>

<p>It is also worth notice that in these clauses the cutting
off of a hand is reckoned as <i>half</i> of the ‘<i>pretium
sanguinis</i>.’ This is in full accordance with the Brehon
rule laid down in the ‘Book of Aicill’ (iii. p. 349).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Half the eric-fine of every person is to be paid for a foot, a
hand, an eye, a tongue.</p>

</div>

<p>But inasmuch as the ‘eric-fine’ in this case
might be taken by mistake to include the honour-price
as well as the coirp-dire, the commentary adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He is entitled to half ‘coirp-dire’ and half compensation
(aithgin) and full honour-price.</p>

</div>

<p>The loss of the hand was reckoned at half the
coirp-dire. The full honour-price was due for the
insult or assault.</p>

<p>Yet another clause in these canons seems to show
that not only the coirp-dire of seven cumhals was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
familiar to the makers of the canons, but also the
honour-price.</p>

<p>In the Brehon Laws the honour-price was payable
for breach of a chieftain’s protection, and in the case
of the Ri-tuaith or kingly chieftain of a Tuath the
honour-price was, as we have seen, seven cumhals.
And so also was that of the bishop of the church in
his territory.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Honour-price’

<p>Accordingly, in the following clause in the canons
the bishop is put in the same position as a king,
with what was practically an honour-price of seven
ancillæ:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

or to take away from or commit
anything against them heedlessly,
shall pay the price of seven
ancillæ or do penance for seven
years with a bishop or scribe.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>So that, though it is not very easy to put an exact
date upon these canons, they seem clearly to adopt and
confirm for ecclesiastical persons the Irish coirp-dire
of seven ancillæ, and the highest honour-price also
of seven ancillæ. And further the <i>ancilla</i> of these
canons was, it appears, of the same silver value as the
<i>cumhal</i> of the Brehon Laws.</p>

<h3>VI. THE BRETON OR GALLIC WERGELD OF THE
SO-CALLED ‘CANONES WALLICI.’</h3>

<p>It is perhaps possible with help from another set
of canons to obtain further evidence of Celtic usage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
as to the fine for homicide, and what is still more to
the point, to trace it back to the Continental side of
the Channel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The so-called
‘Canones
Wallici’
of perhaps
the
Breton
Church.</div>

<p>At the end of the Latin version of the Dimetian
Code of South Wales are appended as part of chapter
<span class="smcapuc">XLIX.</span> several clauses which do not belong to the Code
and are quite inconsistent with its provisions. These
clauses are carelessly extracted, with variations, from
a set of canons which, from their thus partly appearing
at the end of the Latin version of the Dimetian
Code, have come to be known as the ‘Canones
Wallici.’</p>

<p>The oldest MS. of this document is referred to the
8th century, and the canons themselves are referred
by Haddan and Stubbs to the 7th century.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>It is not at all clear that, notwithstanding the
name they have acquired, they are of Welsh origin.</p>

<p>The intercourse between the missionary monks
and churches of Brittany, Cornwall, Wales, and
Ireland was so intimate that there is no difficulty in
understanding how a Welsh scribe or copyist falling
upon these canons should add extracts from them to
a Latin copy he was making of the Dimetian Code.
Whether of Welsh origin or not, some of them may
have been used, amongst others, by the Church in
South Wales.</p>

<p>It may seem presumptuous to doubt their Welsh
origin after the opinion expressed both by Wasserschleben
and such competent authorities as Haddan
and Stubbs, to whose labours the student is so greatly
indebted. But that opinion is doubtfully expressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and reference is made by them to the fact that two
of the three MSS. describe the collection of canons
not as ‘Canones Wallici’ but as ‘<i>excerpta de libris
Romanorum et Francorum</i>,’ and ‘<i>excerpta de libris
Romanis et Francorum</i>’ while the third, of the 8th
century, does not seem to have any heading but
‘<i>Incipit justicium culparum</i>.’ Haddan and Stubbs
assign the origin of these canons to that period
(c. <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 550-650) during which both the Welsh
Church and the Welsh Principalities appear to have
become organised, <i>i.e.</i> to the period following St.
Patrick and St. Finian, during which the monastic
churches of South Wales were the channel of intercourse
between the Breton and Irish Churches. This
<i>collection</i>, according to the same authority, may date
from the 7th century.</p>

<p>The Canons may have been meant for use on both
sides of the Channel. And as they are ‘<i>excerpta</i>’
from books of the Romans and Franks, they seem to
originate from the Continental side, however much
they may have been used in Wales.</p>

<p>When we come to examine them, they bear every
evidence of being ‘<i>excerpta</i>,’ and we know from the
<i>excerpta</i> of Isidor what different materials may be
brought together in such a collection. There is no
continuous plan or order apparently running through
the whole. And certain of the canons, chiefly those
relating to <i>homicide</i>, seem to be marked off from the
remainder by the payments being made throughout
in ‘<i>ancillæ</i>’ and ‘<i>servi</i>’; whilst in most others the
payments are made in <i>libræ argenti</i> or in <i>libræ stagni</i>,
or occasionally in <i>solidi</i>, <i>unciæ</i>, and <i>scripula</i>.</p>

<p>The safer course may be, therefore, to treat them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not as a consistent and single set of canons, but as
<i>excerpta</i> from various sources.</p>

of six
<i>ancillæ</i>
or <i>servi</i>
for
homicide.
The slayer

half and
the

<p>Here, apparently, is a fairly complete and consistent
set of canons relating to homicide. All the
payments are to be made in <i>ancillæ</i> and <i>servi</i>. And
the payment for intentional homicide is apparently a
fixed payment of three ancillæ and three servi, <i>i.e.</i> six
slaves in all. Canons 1 and 2 are consistent and
conclusive on this point.</p>

<p>Now, looking at these canons alone, two facts
point very strongly to an Irish rather than a Welsh
connection, or perhaps we ought to say, to a Goidelic
rather than Cymric connection. In the Brehon Laws,
as we have seen, the payments are made in <i>cumhals</i>
or ancillæ, and the fixed wergeld or <i>coirp-dire</i> is
strictly speaking <i>six</i> ancillæ, and one added for a
special object, making seven cumhals in all. In the
Cymric Codes, on the other hand, the galanas is paid
in cows and never in ancillæ, and the amount of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
galanas is graduated according to rank, that of the
lowest and youngest tribesman being 60 cows,
nearly three times as great as the six ancillæ and
servi of these canons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irish
coirp-dire
apparently
common
to South
Wales
and the
Breton
churches
from fifth
to seventh
century.</div>

<p>The force of these suggestions of Irish connection
is greatly increased by the fact that nowhere else in
the collections of Canons and Penitentials except in
these so-called ‘Canones Wallici’ and the ‘Canones
Hibernenses,’ and closely allied sources, do we find
the payments expressed in ancillæ. And it must be
remembered that the intimacy between Breton and
Cornish saints was mainly with South Wales, and
through South Wales with Ireland, and further that
South Wales, until conquered by Maelguin, was
Goidelic rather than Cymric.</p>

<p>But whether the payment for homicide in the
‘Canones Wallici’ be the coirp-dire of the Brehon
Laws or not, if we may recognise in these rules as to
homicide the customs current in some degree on both
sides of the Channel, let us say from the fifth to the
seventh century, we cannot also fail to recognise in
them evidence of influences at work which have broken
away partly from tribal usage, and which hail, not
from the primitive tribal instincts of Irish or Gallic
tribes, but from the side of Roman and ecclesiastical
law, to which the districts alluded to had long been
subject.</p>

<p>We shall see more and more how foreign the
tribal instinct of the solidarity of the kindred, and
the consequent obligation on the whole kindred for
the whole composition for homicide, were to Roman
law and Christian feeling, and how soon under these
influences the disintegrating process began in Gallo-Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
districts, causing the solidarity of the kindred
to give way.</p>

<p>The solidarity of the kindred is partly recognised
in these canons, but it is also partly ignored.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
extent of
the
liability of
the
parentes
of the
slayer.</div>

<p>The 12th canon states, as we have seen, that if
the murderer had taken flight his parentes had fifteen
days allowed either to pay part and be secure, or
themselves leave the country. What part? The
clause states that if the murderer wished to return
from his exile he might pay the <i>half</i> that remained,
and thereafter live secure. So that it would seem
that the kindred were only liable to pay half, instead
of the whole coirp-dire of six ancillæ and servi.
If, in the meantime, the murderer was killed, presumably
by the parentes of the slain, the slaves, or
whatever else had been received by the parentes of
the slain from the parentes of the slayer, had to be
restored to the latter, the feud having been satisfied
by his death at their hands.</p>

<p>In the Brehon Laws as in the Cymric Codes,
the solidarity of the kindred was complete. As we
have seen, under Irish custom the whole kindred of
the four nearest hearths were liable for the payment
of the <i>coirp-dire</i> for unnecessary homicide. But the
fact that the payment of wergelds was foreign to
Roman law, combined with the claim of the Church
to protect from death criminals taking refuge at the
altar, had no doubt in Northern Gaul, as we shall find
was the case in Southern Gaul also, already begun to
break up to some extent the tribal solidarity on which
joint liability for the payment of wergelds was based.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cleric
who slays
is to give
himself
up to the
slain
person’s
parentes.</div>

<p>Those criminals who claimed protection at the
altar were, under Gallic ecclesiastical usage, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
shall see, saved from death, but at the same time
handed over as slaves to the parentes of the slain. And
it is not difficult to detect the lines of thought leading
to this result. In the ‘Penitentials’ attributed to St.
Finian,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the spirit in which the missionary churches of
Brittany, Wales, and Ireland, from their clerical point
of view, dealt with crime very clearly appears. A
layman, in addition to making composition to the
injured person, should also do penance; but a cleric
who possessed no property of his own could not
pay the composition (s. 9, p. 110). What, then, was
he to do in a case of homicide? The penitential
(s. 23) lays down the rule:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If any cleric kills his neighbour he must undergo ten years’
banishment with seven years’ penance. If after ten years he
has acted rightly and is approved by the testimony of the abbot
or priest, let him be received back into his country and let him
satisfy the friends of him whom he has killed. Let him return to
the father or mother (of the slain), if alive, saying ‘Behold I, as for
your son, will do whatsoever you tell me.’ If he does not rightly
do this he is not to be received&mdash;‘in eternum.’</p>

</div>

<p>Then in s. 53 is added, ‘If any one will propose
better rules we will accept and follow them.’</p>

<p>To sum up the evidence of the canons, we can
hardly claim to have done more than to have connected
the coirp-dire of the Brehon Laws with the
<i>pretium hominis</i> of St. Patrick, and with the <i>pretium
sanguinis</i> of the ‘Canones Hibernenses,’ and with the
clauses relating to homicide excerpted by the compiler
of the so-called ‘Canones Wallici’ from the
books of the Romans and Franks.</p>

<p>The connection, though traceable only through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ecclesiastical channels, seems to establish a continuity
as regards the fixed payment for homicide between the
Breton and Irish churches, and possibly the churches
of the Goidelic portion of South Wales, of the fifth
and sixth centuries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuity
of
Irish and
Breton
custom as
regards
the
‘pretium
hominis’
and payment
in
ancillæ.</div>

<p>If it were suggested that the <i>pretium hominis</i> of
seven ancillæ might be an ecclesiastical invention
originating with the missionary churches of the
Armorican districts of Gaul, we should still have to
inquire why these churches differed so much from
other Gallic churches. Everywhere else the Church,
finding it impossible to get rid of a deep-rooted
custom, seems to have made compacts with the secular
power, adopting the customary system of wergelds
prevalent in each of the conquered and converted
tribes, and giving to the several grades in the
ecclesiastical hierarchy graduated wergelds placing
them on a level with corresponding classes of tribesmen
or laymen. Even in these Celtic Canons the
clerical instinct, whilst apparently adopting the fixed
wergeld or coirp-dire for laymen, claimed for the
clergy a graduated wergeld.</p>

<p>The bishop, as we have seen according to the
canons, claimed a sevenfold <i>pretium hominis</i>&mdash;seven
times the price of seven ancillæ&mdash;because of his
rank in the clerical hierarchy. He claimed too the
<i>honour-price</i> of seven ancillæ&mdash;the same as that of the
Irish chieftain of a district for breach of his protection
or precinct. The bishop seems to place himself
here as elsewhere in these matters, on a level with the
secular prince or even with the king.</p>

<p>And again, if St. Patrick in his ‘Confessions’
(a work the authenticity of which is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
accepted) could use, as he did, the <i>pretium hominis</i>
as a well-known unit of payment, it would seem that
at least as early as the end of the fifth century the
value of the <i>pretium hominis</i> as a unit of payment was
perfectly well understood. And this in itself is a
proof of further antiquity.</p>

<p>The redeeming of baptized captives from slavery
was moreover a recognised method of increasing the
number of converts to the Christian Faith. In his
equally authentic Epistle to the subjects of Coroticus
St. Patrick speaks of the Roman and Gallic custom of
Christians to send holy and fit men to the Franks and
other nations with so many thousands of solidi for
redeeming baptized captives, while Coroticus was killing
and selling captives to a foreign people ignorant
of God. Mr. Whitley Stokes, in editing this letter,
suggests that this passage points to a date before the
conversion of the Franks (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 496).<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The traffic in
captives and slaves, and their sale perhaps into a
still pagan corner of France, accords with the
strangely local use of the <i>ancilla</i> as the unit of
payment as well in the Canons as in the Brehon
Laws.</p>

<p>What, then, are we to make of this fixed wergeld
of seven ancillæ? So far, we find it prevalent only
in Ireland and in the Goidelic or non-Cymric
districts of South Wales and Brittany. And the
evidence seems to carry it back to the fifth
century.</p>

<h3>VII. THE WERGELD OF ANCIENT GALLIC CUSTOM.
THE EVIDENCE OF CÆSAR.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Cæsar
does not
state the
amount
of the
Gallic
wergeld,
but the
Druids
had jurisdiction
in
cases of
homicide.</div>

<p>There seems to be left but one possible further
source of evidence as regards the wergelds of the
Gallic tribes before the Roman conquest, viz. that of
Cæsar. Speaking of the Druids, his words are
these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Illi rebus divinis intersunt, sacrificia publica ac privata procurant,
religiones interpretantur. Ad eos magnus adulescentium
numerus disciplinæ causa concurrit, magnoque hi sunt apud eos
honore. Nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque
constituunt, et, si quod est admissum facinus, <i>si cædes facta</i>, si
de hereditate, si de finibus controversia est, iidem decernunt,
præmia pœnasque constituunt (vi. 13).</p>

</div>

<p>There is certainly nothing in these words, when
carefully considered, which indicates in the slightest
degree whether the Gallic wergeld was fixed, or
graduated according to rank. They amount to
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Druids have cognisance of nearly all public and private
controversies, and if any crime has been committed, if a murder
has been done, if concerning inheritance, if concerning boundaries
there is controversy, it is they who decide, and they fix the compensation
and penalties.</p>

</div>

<p>On the occasion of any murder committed, there
would be plenty of room for controversy whether
the wergeld were fixed or graduated according to
rank, or even, as is quite possible, left open to the
judgment of the Druids. So that we gain nothing
from Cæsar’s evidence on this particular point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
further than that the penalties for slaying were within
the jurisdiction of the Druids.</p>

<p>It may, however, be well to notice that this
passage has been the subject of controversy upon
another point of interest to this inquiry: viz. on
the question whether the evidence of Cæsar should
be taken as in favour of the theory of the
communistic ownership of land in Gaul or that of
individual ownership.</p>

<p>M. Fustel de Coulanges<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> has argued with great
force that the statement of Cæsar that the Druids
were accustomed to settle controversies whether
<i>de hereditate</i> or <i>de finibus</i> implies that in his view
there must have been something like private
property whether of individuals or of families.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
evidence
of Cæsar
on tribal
landholding.</div>

<p>Now if a connection may be traced between
the liability of the whole kindred for wergeld
and the occupation of land by kindreds, with lesser
divisions into something like <i>gwelys</i>, then, without
pressing the point too far, without suggesting that
the Welsh or the Irish form of tribal occupation of
land may have been exactly that which in Cæsar’s
time prevailed in Gaul, we may at least say that the
analogy of the Welsh and Irish examples would lead
us, from a tribal point of view, to judge that the
form of land occupation in Gaul was not likely to be
either absolute individual or absolute communal
ownership. And as under Welsh and Irish tribal
custom and forms of land occupation there was
plenty of room for public and private controversies
both <i>de hereditate</i> and <i>de finibus</i>, it may fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
be suggested that some form of tribal land occupation
would at least be more consistent with what
Cæsar recorded in the few sentences under review
than either complete individual or complete communal
ownership would be.</p>

<p>But, passing from the passages already quoted to
Cæsar’s further statements relating to the Druids,
light seems to pour from them into another matter
otherwise very difficult to realise.</p>

<p>It is at first sight with something like amazement
that we view the arrogance of the pretension of the
missionary priests of the Christian Church to impose
what must have been galling penances upon chieftains
and tribesmen who had committed crimes of
murder or incest. Still more surprised might we
well be that they had any chance of securing
obedience.</p>

<p>The evidence of Gildas and of the Cadoc records
quoted in a former volume is sufficient to show that
to a most astonishing extent even chieftains submitted
to the penalties and penances imposed by priests and
monks who were claiming for themselves immunity
from secular services and payments. The very fact
that the Ecclesiastical Canons contain the rules we
have examined as to the payments for homicide by
the kindred of the murderer seems to involve the bold
claim of the Church to bring the punishment of
crime within its jurisdiction. We have seen also how
in these Canons the right of the bishop to be placed
in social rank on a level with the highest chieftains
and princes and kings was already taken for granted
in the corner of Gaul so closely connected with South
Wales and Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The position
of
the
Druids
paved
the way
for clerical
pretensions.</div>

<p>The statement of Cæsar opens our eyes to the
extent to which under the earliest prevalent system
of religious belief the way was paved both for these
clerical pretensions and also for the submission of
chieftains and people to the penances imposed.</p>

<p>After describing, as above, the prerogatives of
the Druids, Cæsar adds a few words to describe the
nature of the <i>sanctions</i> by which obedience to their
awards was secured:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

<p>It is not necessary here to follow further these
familiar passages in the ‘De Bello Gallico’ or to
inquire more deeply into the religion of the Gauls.
It is enough that the religion or superstition of the
Gauls was sufficient in itself, and sufficiently deeply
believed in, to fortify the influence and power of the
Druids with the necessary sanction, and to outlive
the disintegration which Roman conquest, in spite of
its tolerance to tribal religions, must have in degree
produced. The testimony of Renan to the deep-rooted
superstition of the Breton population, and the
lingering presence even to this day of instincts and
customs reaching back to a stratum of indigenous
ideas underlying Roman and Christian civilisation,
shows, as Irish and Welsh legends do also, that
feelings of this kind are not subject to sudden
change.</p>

<p>And when we try to realise the position and
work of the early Gallic or Breton or Cornish or
Welsh or Irish churches from the fifth century
onwards, we seem to see how their position and
work were made possible only by the fact that what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was technically called the conversion of a people
to Christianity was not after all so great a revolution
as one might at first sight have thought.</p>

<p>The missionary monks or priests, it might almost
be said, <i>naturally</i> took the place of the Druids in
the minds of the people. They had power to shut out
the criminal from the sacrifices of the Christian
altar, just as the Druids could from theirs. The
conversion, such as it was, meant at least that in
the belief of the people the spiritual powers were
transferred to the priest, and that the old sanctions
of superstition naturally followed the transfer.
Thereby was secured to the Church something of the
same prestige and power which had once belonged
to the priests of the old religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The tribes
were used
to the

power of
the

<p>When it is considered how the organised and
world-wide system of the Church, with its centre in
Rome, continuing to some extent the prestige and the
civilisation of Imperial Rome, must have appeared to
the chieftains and petty kings of uncivilised tribes,
it may be recognised that in this respect also it
resembled to their eyes the power of the priesthood
of the old religion with its centre at Chartres and
reaching in its authority from Britain to Southern
Gaul. So that in this respect also the way was paved
for the Church in the minds of the people. The
tribes were used to the idea of a great central
spiritual power, and in the Church, by transfer from
the old to the new religion, they found it again.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE WERGELDS OF THE BURGUNDIAN AND
WISIGOTHIC LAWS.</i></span></h2>

<h3>I. THE BURGUNDIAN WERGELDS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The result
of contact
with
Roman
and
Christian
civilisation.</div>

<p>It is not proposed to do more in this chapter than
very briefly to examine the laws of the Burgundians
and Wisigoths with reference to the evidence they contain
with regard to the results of contact with Roman
and Christian civilisation upon the solidarity of the
kindred as shown in the payment of wergelds.</p>

<p>The remoteness of these tribes from any connection
with the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain
makes it unnecessary to do more than this. Indeed,
this chapter might have been omitted but for the
useful light it may throw upon the process of disintegration
in tribal custom in the case of tribes
settling in countries with a long-established civilisation
superior to their own. In such cases tribal custom,
however hardly it might resist, had eventually
to succumb, thus affording a strong contrast with
the Cymric and Irish examples, in which tribal custom
was so much better able to hold its own, and even
succeeded to some extent in forcing tribal rules upon
the new Christian institutions.</p>

<p>The Burgundian laws, so far as they belong to
those first issued by Gundebald himself, fall between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 501 and 516, and his reference to his ancestors
in his preface shows that, while he may have remodelled
the laws to meet altered circumstances, they
were in part based upon traditional customs of his
people.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>But his people were in a new position. Geographically
they were sharing with a population
still under Roman law the south-western part of the
Helvetian Valley&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> between Neuchâtel and Geneva,
and a good part of the old country of the Sequani
on the Gallic side of the Jura.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
method of
settlement.</div>

<p>They seem to have come into this district not
altogether as conquerors, but in some sense as
invited guests. According to Tit. 54 of the laws the
newcomers, by the munificence of the Burgundian
king and his ancestors, had had delegated to them
individually, in a particular place, <i>hospitalitas</i>, which
consisted of two thirds of the land and one third of
the slaves of the <i>hospes</i> upon whom they were
quartered, and by this clause in the laws they were
forbidden to take more.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It is generally understood
that this method more or less closely resembled the
Roman method of quartering soldiers upon a district.</p>

<p>The Burgundians therefore came into a district
with a mixed population of Romanised Gauls and
Germans, already, after long residence and many
vicissitudes, living and settled under Roman law, and
regarded by the newcomers as Romans.</p>

<p>Thus two sets of laws became necessary, one for
the Burgundian immigrants, the other for the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
inhabitants who were to continue under Roman
law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homicide
under the
‘Lex
Romana.’</div>

<p>Now under the Roman law there was no wergeld.
And so in the Tit. II. of the Burgundian <i>Lex Romana</i>
the slayer, whether a freeman or slave, if captured
outside a church was condemned to death. If the
homicide was in defence of life it was to be referred
to judicial decision according to the Novellæ
of Theodosius and Valentinian.</p>

<p>If the slayer had taken refuge in a church, <i>quia
de preciis occisionum nihil evidenter lex Romana constituit</i>,
the Burgundian lawgiver decreed that if a
freeman by a freeman should be killed, and the
slayer should flee to a church, he who confessed the
homicide should be adjudged to be the slave of the
heirs of the person killed, with half of his property,
the other half to be left to the heirs of the slayer.</p>

<p>After this follows a clause, also of Burgundian
origin, fixing the payment by a freeman who has
killed a ‘servus’ and fled to a church. The price is
to be paid to the lord of the servus on the following
scale:</p>

<table summary="Payments due for killing different classes of person">

  </tr>
</table>

<div class="sidenote">Under
the
Burgundian
Law.</div>

<p>Now if from these clauses of the Lex Romana
which relate to the Roman population, we turn to
the Tit. II. of the Burgundian law proper of Gundebald
‘De homicidiis,’ we may gather what the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
customary wergelds may have been, but at the same
time recognise how strongly Roman law and ecclesiastical
influence had led Gundebald to break
through what to the Romanised conscience seemed
to be the worst features of the system of tribal
wergelds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Original
wergelds
no longer
adhered
to.
Homicide
punished
by death.</div>

<p>From Tit. II., ‘De homicidiis,’ it appears that the
original wergelds were these:</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Optimatus nobilis</td>
    <td class="tdr">300</td>
    <td>solidi</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Aliquis in populo mediocris</td>
    <td class="tdr">200</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Minor persona</td>
    <td class="tdr">150</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pretium servi</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These wergelds closely correspond with those of
the Alamannic and Bavarian laws; but the first
clause enacts that the homicide of a freeman by
another, of whatsoever nation, shall only be compounded
for by the slayer’s blood: thus overriding
tribal usage and introducing the Roman law.</p>

<p>The second clause enacts that if the homicide be
in self-defence against violence, half the above-mentioned
wergelds should be payable to the parentes
of the slain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homicide
by a slave.</div>

<p>Clause 3 enacts that if a slave, unknown to his
master, shall slay a freeman, the slave shall be delivered
up to death and the master free from liability.
Clause 4 adds that if the master was privy to the
crime of his slave both should be delivered to death.
Clause 5 enacts that if the slave after the deed shall
have disappeared, his master shall pay 30 solidi&mdash;the
price of the slave&mdash;to the parentes of the slain. And
lastly, in clause 6, the parentes of the slain are in all
these cases warned that no one is to be answerable
for the crime but the homicide himself, ‘because as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
we enact that the guilty shall be extirpated, so we
cannot allow the innocent to suffer wrong.’</p>

<p>The new law breaks away altogether from old
tribal traditions, and an attempt is made to treat
homicide from the new point of view of reason and
justice as between one individual and another, with
but little, if any, regard to kindred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The traditional
value of
animals.</div>

<p>From the law against theft we get a scale for the
equation of cattle &amp;c. with gold. If a Burgundian
or Roman ‘ingenuus’ steals away a slave, horse,
mare, ox, or cow, he is to lose his life, unless he
takes refuge in a church, and from the property of
the criminal the price of the stolen animal is, ‘in
simplum,’ to be paid to the person robbed, unless
the thing stolen can be found and restored&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>:</p>

<table summary="Value of slaves and animals">
  <tr>
    <td>For the slave</td>
    <td class="tdr">25</td>
    <td>solidi</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For ‘best horse’</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For moderate horse</td>
    <td class="tdr">5</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For mare</td>
    <td class="tdr">3</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For ox</td>
    <td class="tdr">2</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For cow</td>
    <td class="tdr">1</td>
    <td>solidus.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Thus from these traditional values, retained even
under new circumstances by the Burgundian law, we
learn that the wergeld of the middle class of freemen,
‘mediocres in populo,’ of 200 solidi, was still regarded
as the equivalent of 100 oxen or 200 cows.</p>

<p>There is no doubt in this case that the solidi were
those of the Imperial standard. The Burgundian
Kingdom was destroyed by the Franks in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 534&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
before the issue by Merovingian princes of solidi
and trientes of the Merovingian standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<h3>II. THE WERGELDS OF THE LEX WISIGOTHORUM.</h3>

<p>The laws of the Wisigoths are too Roman to be
taken as evidence of what may have been the ancient
tribal wergelds of the Goths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The tribal
polity of
the Goths
broken up
by Roman
influences.</div>

<p>Their rule extended to the Loire till they were
driven back to the Garonne by the Franks in the
sixth century, and lasted in Spain and Aquitaine to
711 when it succumbed to Arab conquest. The
Wisigoths conquered a country already under Roman
law, with a mixed population of German as well as
Celtic and Iberian tribes. They were not the first
German intruders. They were invaders, but not
altogether at enmity with the Romans. Their princes,
after the break-up of the Roman power, issued gold
coins&mdash;solidi and tremisses&mdash;in close imitation of
those of the Eastern Empire. Goth and Roman were
encouraged to marry on equal terms. And though
there are traces of a scale of payments in composition
for homicide, it bears little trace of the tribal principle
of the solidarity of the kindred.</p>

<p>There is no scale of payments directly under the
head of homicide, and we are left to gather incidentally
what the wergeld (if it can be so called) may
have been.</p>

<p>In a clause<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> added between 653 and 672 it was
enacted that upon the kidnapping of the child&mdash;son
or daughter&mdash;of a free man or woman, the criminal
was to be delivered over into the power of the child’s
father, or mother, brother or nearest parentes, so
that they may have power to kill him or sell him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
And if they desired it, they might demand the composition
for homicide from the criminal, <i>i.e.</i> 500
solidi (some MSS. 300 solidi), the crime being to the
parents no less grave than homicide. If the child
could be recovered, half the composition for homicide
was to be paid, and if the criminal could not pay
he was to become their slave.</p>

<p>This doubtful mention of 500 solidi or 300 solidi
finds some explanation in a later clause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
wergeld
graduated
according
to the
age of the
individual.</div>

<p>Indirectly, again, we get the scale in force for
homicides in L. VIII. Tit. IV. s. 161, of about the
same date. It enacted that injuries done by vicious
animals, known to be such, were to be paid for <i>sicut
est de homicidiis</i> by the ‘constituted composition’&mdash;<i>compositio
constituta</i>&mdash;and then the following scale is

<div class="sidenote">Innocent

<p>It is impossible to look upon this scale as fully
representing ancient Gothic tribal tradition. And
when we turn to the title ‘<i>De cæde et morte hominum</i>,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
which seems to belong to the same date, it becomes
obvious how far the spirit of these laws had wandered
away from any tribal standpoint and from all recognition
of the solidarity of the kindred. A homicide
committed unknowingly (‘nesciens’) is declared to be
in the sight of God no cause of death. ‘Let the man
who has committed it depart secure.’<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Every man who killed another intentionally, and
not by accident, was to be punished for homicide.
The punishment had, in fact, already become a
matter of criminal law. The prosecution for homicide
was no longer to be left only to the parentes of the
slain, ‘for they might be lukewarm’ (s. 15). The
judex ought to take the matter up, and on neglect of
his duty was to be liable for half the payment for
homicide, viz. 250 solidi. Strangers in blood as well
as relations had already been enabled to bring the
accusation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homicides

<p>Chindasvinthe, who reigned from 642 to 653,
had legislated in the same direction. The question
had arisen, what was to be done with homicides
who took refuge in a church and committed themselves
to the protection of God? Seeing that every
one ought to be punished for his crime, he issued
an edict to settle this question once for all. He
enacted that whatever slayer or evil-doer the law
required to be punished, no power whatever should
be able to shield from punishment. And although
the criminal might flee to the sacred altar, and in
that case no prosecutor could drag him away without
the concurrence of the priest, yet the priest, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
been consulted, the sacrament having been given,
was to repel the criminal from the altar, and expel
him from the choir, so that his prosecutor might
apprehend him. The criminal thus expelled was to
be freed from any further death penalty, but short of
this was to be in the power of the parentes of the
slain, who might do what they liked with him, <i>i.e.</i>
he became their slave unless presumably the composition
required was paid.</p>

another point in which tribal instinct was at variance
with Roman law. With the dissolution of the
kindred disappeared the reason and traditional
justification for the rule that there was no feud
and no wergeld within the kindred. Tribal custom
everywhere left the worst crime of all&mdash;murder of a
parent or a kinsman&mdash;without redress, at the same
time unpardonable and unavenged. It became,
therefore, needful to promulgate an edict that the
judex should punish the murder of a kinsman by
death. And in this case, if there were no children,
all the murderer’s property was to go to the
heirs and near relations of the murdered person.
But if there were children of another marriage,
innocent of their parent’s crime, half only of the
property was to go to the children of the murdered
kinsman, and half to the innocent children of the
parricide.</p>

<p>If the murderer had fled to the altar of a church
he was to be delivered up to the parentes or propinqui
of the slain kinsman, to be dealt with as
they chose, short of death, and if there were no such
parentes his property was to go to the fisc. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
murderer whose life was thus spared was not to have
the use of the property.</p>

<p>Lastly there is found in some of the MSS., as an
addition to Lib. XII. Tit. II., an edict of King Wamba,
who reigned 672-680, which seems to mark the last
stage in the process of confining the punishment of
the crime to the criminal alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
punishment
had
become a
matter of
criminal
law and
was confined
to the
criminal
alone.</div>

<p>Up to this time, as we have seen, the murderer
<i>with all his possessions</i> was by law to remain the
slave of the parentes, or the next heirs of the
murdered person, except in the one case of the
murderer having children by another wife. Thenceforth,
if the murderer, according to the edict, had
children or wife free from participation in the crime,
he alone was to be delivered up to the parentes or
next heirs of the dead. His possessions were not to
go to them, but to the children or heirs of the <i>criminal</i>,
on the ground that the punishment should in justice
fall alone upon the sinner, and not upon his innocent
family. Clearly the last tie of tribal instinct securing
the solidarity of kindreds was now broken. It had
lost its ancient significance. Murder had become the
crime of an individual against the State, and a matter
of criminal law. The only survival of tribal feeling
seems to have been that, as some compensation to
the family of the murdered man, the murderer whose
life the Church had saved was to become their slave.</p>

<h3>I. THE WERGELDS OF THE LEX SALICA.</h3>

<p>In turning now to the Lex Salica the inquiry will again
at first more or less be a study of wergelds.</p>

<p>There are many difficult points in the construction
of the Lex Salica, and the capitularies connected with
it, which, after all the learned labour expended
upon them, still remain unsettled. To attempt
to discuss them fully would involve an amount of
research and erudition to which this essay can lay no
claim. All that can be attempted in this survey of the
traces of tribal custom in the laws of the Continental
tribes is to approach their text afresh in the light
of the Cymric evidence, as a tentative first step
towards, at last, approaching the Anglo-Saxon laws
from the same tribal point of view and from the
vantage-ground of a previous study of the survivals
of tribal custom elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
district
within
which
the Lex
Salica had
force.</div>

<p>The Lex Salica had force apparently at first over
the Franks of the district extending from the <i>Carbonaria
Silva</i> on the left bank of the Meuse to the
River Loire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
sixty-five
chapters
about
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 500,
but with
later alterations.</div>

<p>The earliest manuscripts of the Lex Salica are
considered to belong to the late eighth or early
ninth century. And the general opinion seems to be
that the first sixty-five chapters may be ascribed to
the time of Clovis, or at least to a period before
Christianity had become general among the Franks.</p>

<p>The reign of Clovis extended from <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 481 to
511, and may perhaps be taken as covering the date
when the sixty-five chapters were first framed. There
is, however, no proof that they were not modified
afterwards. For at the end of the celebrated chapter
<i>De chrenecruda</i> there is a clause in a later manuscript
which implies that it was no longer in force.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>If these sixty-five titles, in their original form,
really go back to the time of Clovis, the fact that they
were allowed to continue in late issues of the Lex
Salica along with the additions made to it, is probably
enough in itself to excite suspicion that even these
may not have been allowed to remain as they
originally stood without modification.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edict of
Childebert
II. <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
599 on
homicide
discourages
receipt
and payment
of
wergelds.</div>

<p>Particularly on the question of homicide and the
liability of the kindred of the slayer in the payment
of the wergeld, it is difficult to understand how the
clauses relating to its payment and receipt, if representing
fully more ancient custom, could have been
left altogether unaltered after the decree of Childebert
II. (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 599), which may be translated as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Concerning homicides we order the following to be observed:
That whoever by rash impulse shall have killed another without
cause shall be in peril of his life. For not by any price of redemption
shall he redeem or compound for himself. Should it by
chance happen that any one shall stoop to (make or receive?)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
payment, no one of his parentes or friends shall aid him at all,
unless he who shall presume to aid him at all shall pay the whole
of the wergeld, because it is just that he who knows how to
kill should learn to die. (Pertz, <i>Leges</i>, i. p. 10.)</p>

</div>

<p>The logic of this decree is curious. The slayer’s
kindred were absolved by it from liability if they
chose to stand aloof. But, if they stooped to help
their kinsman at all, they must see to it that the
whole wergeld was paid, no doubt to avoid breaches
of the peace from attempts at private revenge if any
part were left unpaid. But if the slayer’s relations
did not pay the wergeld&mdash;what then? The slayer
was to be left ‘in peril of his life.’ From whom? It
must have been from the vengeance of the slain man’s
kindred.</p>

<p>One would have thought that this decree would
have defeated itself, for apparently, whilst it absolved
the murderer’s kindred from obligation to assist the
murderer to pay the wergeld, it left untouched the
right of vengeance on the part of the slain man’s
relations, thereby, one would have thought, multiplying
cases of breach of the peace.</p>

<p>That clauses relative to receipt and payment of
wergeld were left in the Lex after this decree shows
probably that the system of wergelds remained
practically still in force. People went on ‘living
under the Lex Salica,’ after the date of the edict, and
in spite of the latter no doubt wergelds were paid
and received. But whilst this may have been a
reason why the clauses regulating the payment and
receipt of wergelds could not be altogether omitted,
it may also have made necessary the modification of
some of their provisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>One may even venture to trace motives in the
making of modifications in favour of the fisc, which
can hardly have had their root in ancient tribal
custom.</p>

<p>The system of wergelds was extended to the
advantage of ultimately both official and clerical
hierarchies, and even from the Franks themselves to
strangers and to the Gallo-Roman population amongst
whom they dwelt. And the whole character and
system of the ‘Lex Salica’ was so much like a statement
of crimes and the composition to be paid for
them that it lent itself very easily to the interest of
the fisc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lex
allowed
a tribesman
to
break
himself
away
from his
kindred.
And
the fisc
gained
by it.</div>

<p>In the sixty-five titles themselves there is direct
evidence that tribal tradition and the solidarity of
the kindred had once existed, and that in spite of
the edict the fisc was interested in their maintenance.
Thus by Tit. LX., <i>De eum qui se de parentilla tollere
vult</i>, a door was thrown wide open for the Salic
tribesman to escape from the obligations of kindred.
To secure this object he is to go to the mallus with
three branches of alder, and break them over his
head, and throw them on four sides in the mallus,
and declare that he withdraws from the oath, and the
inheritance, and everything belonging to the parentilla,
so that thereafter, if any of his parentes either is
killed or shall die, no part either of the inheritance
or of the composition shall pertain to him, but all go
to the fisc. If we take this clause strictly it implies
and sanctions the general right of a kinsman of a slain
person to share in his wergeld. The share of the kinsman,
who under this clause frees himself from the
liability to pay, and gives up his right to receive any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
portion of the wergeld of a relative, does not lapse
altogether, but is apparently kept alive for the fisc.</p>

<p>This clause is not perhaps inconsistent with the
edict which left the receipt of wergeld still possible,
though payment by the slayer’s kindred was optional.
And so long as the occasional receipt of wergeld
was still possible, rules for its division might reasonably
remain in the Lex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tit. LXII.,
‘De compositione
homicidii.’</div>

<p>The same may perhaps be said of other clauses
included in the original sixty-five. Tit. LXII.,
<i>De compositione homicidii</i>, is the one which deals
with the division of the wergeld by its recipients, <i>i.e.</i>
the kindred of the person slain. According to the
text of Hessels, Cod. I., it is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si cujuscumque pater occisus
fuerit medietatem compositionis
filii collegant, et aliam medietatem
parentes quae proximiores sunt
tam de patre quam de matre inter
se dividant.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If any one’s father be killed,
the sons are to take collectively
one half of the composition, and
the other half is to be divided
between the parentes who are
proximiores, both of the paternal
and maternal kindreds.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Quod si de nulla paterna seu
materna nullus parens non fuerit,
illa portio in fisco collegatur.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">But if there be parentes on
neither side,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> paternal or maternal,
then that portion (<i>i.e.</i> the second
half) is to go to the fisc.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>According to this clause, in the absence of the
parentes, their half share still has to be paid by the
kindred of the slayer, but again the fisc gets control
of the lapsed portion which the parentes would have
taken had they been forthcoming.</p>

important one, Tit. CI., <i>De hominem ingenuo occiso</i>,

was necessary in the division of the wergeld
amongst the kindred of the slain.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There must have been some special object in
this addition to the Lex. Brunner, following the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
very plausible suggestion of Wilda and Boretius,
points out that the ‘mother,’ who, if alive, is to share
in the second half of the wergeld, may be the mother
of the son who takes the first half, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>widow of
the person slain</i>, otherwise why should the mother
alone be mentioned, and not the father of the slain?<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
If this view may be accepted the object of the clause
becomes at once apparent.</p>

<p>Under Tit. LXII. no share is given to the widow.
And we have learned from the Cymric example the
reason why tribal custom gave no part of the wergeld
of the husband to the widow. It was simply
because there was no blood relationship between
them. The widow and her kindred would have taken
no part in the feud, and so took no part of the galanas
in composition for the feud.</p>

<p>The silence of Tit. LXII. and the force of the
Cymric precedent warrant the inference that it may
have been so also under ancient Salic custom.
However this may be, the fact that an addition to
the Lex was made, whether in favour of the widow
or of the mother, seems to show that Roman and
Christian influences had introduced other considerations
than those of blood relationship, so breaking
in upon tribal custom and necessitating special
legislation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three
‘parentillæ’
sharing
in the
wergeld.</div>

<p>If this view may be accepted, and if (as we had
to do in interpreting the Brehon rules regarding
divisions of the kindred) we may take the word ‘son’
as meaning all the sons, and insert the word <i>parentillæ</i>
in explanation of the three <i>proximiores</i>, so as to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
them (as in the Brehon <i>Geilfine</i> division) to be
not three persons but three groups of kindred, then
these clauses become fairly intelligible and consistent
with Tit. LXII.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The wergeld is divided into two halves and the
second half (subject to the newly inserted right of
the widow or mother of the slain) goes to the three
groups of proximiores. What these three groups or
parentillæ may be is not very clear.</p>

<p>The father has been killed and his sons take the
first half of the wergeld. The other half is taken by
the three nearer parentillæ. The nearest group at
first sight would be the descendants of the two
parents of the slain. The second group would
be the descendants of the four grandparents of the
slain. The third group should include the descendants
of the eight great-grandparents of the person
slain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three
‘parentillæ’
include
descendants
of
great-great
grandparents.</div>

<p>But Brunner has pointed out that the division
into paternal and maternal lines of relationship
begins with the slain person’s grandparents; so that
the three proximiores on both sides should go back
to the descendants of great-great-grandparents. He
also points out that, as at each step the nearer group
are to take two thirds and those behind it one third,
the division between the three groups would be in
the proportions of 6:2:1. And he quotes a statement
regarding the division of wergelds in Flanders
in the year 1300, in which the proportions of the
payments of the three groups of relatives were
still as 6:2:1. The half falling to the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
groups being reckoned as 18/36, the division was as
under:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Division of wergelds">

</table>

<p>We may then safely, I think, follow Brunner’s
cautiously expressed conclusion that it is very probable
that also in the Lex Salica under the words
‘tres proximiores’ are intended relations belonging
to three separate parentillæ.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The
wergeld
from the
payer’s
point of
view</div>

<p>So far we have dealt only with the <i>receivers</i> of the
wergeld. We have now to consider the wergeld from
the <i>payers’</i> point of view. When at last we turn to
the title ‘<i>De chrenecruda</i>,’ which deals with the <i>payment</i>
of the wergeld by the slayer and his kindred, we
seem all at once to breathe in the atmosphere of
ancient tribal custom before it had been materially
tainted by the new influences, which the conquest of
a Romanised country and migration into the midst of
a mixed population necessarily brought with them.
The force of tribal instinct survives in this clause
even though since the edict of Childebert II. it may
have been allowed to remain in the Lex partly on
sufferance, and even though some of its details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
have been made incoherent by the mutilation it may
have undergone. It was probably left in its place in
the Lex, together with the clauses regarding the receipt
of wergeld, because, even though the assistance of the
kindred in the payment of wergeld had been made
optional and discouraged, the instincts of kindred
were not to be extinguished all at once. To save
the life of a kinsman, kinsmen will sometimes exercise
the option. And the slayer, before he flees for his
life, will make his appeal to his kinsmen. The old
traditional rules for payment will have force in the
feelings of those who, under all the discouragements
of the law, still choose to assist the slayer. Moreover,
the Mallus, it appears, still exercised jurisdiction
over the option.</p>

<p>This celebrated clause may perhaps therefore be
quoted as evidence for so much of ancient tribal custom
as to wergelds as the royal edict was unable to
extinguish all at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The title
‘De
chrenecruda.’</div>

<p>Difficulty arises chiefly from the imperfect condition
of the text of one of the clauses. But, keeping close

<p>Now, if we are here dealing with actual tribal
custom, it is natural to place some weight upon the
picturesque incidents which testify to its traditional
origin. These picturesque incidents can hardly be
other than proofs of antiquity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The slayer
and his co-swearers
declare
that he
has given
up everything.</div>

<p>Let us try, then, in spite of some confusion in the
text, to make out the probable meaning of the action
described. Clause 1 makes it clear that the first
public step taken on the part of the slayer was to go
to the Mallus with twelve co-swearers, who with him
pledge their faith that he has given up everything,
above ground or below it, towards the wergeld.
There must have been previous negotiations with the
kinsmen of the slain, and a stay of vengeance must
have been conceded on the understanding that if
possible the wergeld will be paid. Having thus
obtained legal security for a time, the next stage in
the proceeding is one between the slayer and his
kinsmen, without whose help he cannot pay the
wergeld.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The family
gathering
to arrange
for payment
of
the rest
of the
wergeld.</div>

<p>The graphic details of the second clause seem to
involve the presence of a family gathering met within
the enclosure containing the house of the slayer, and,
for anything we know, other houses of near relations.
In this enclosure the kindred have met to deal with a
family catastrophe in which they themselves are
involved as well as the slayer. Even if they have to
find only their half of the wergeld, fifty head of cattle
from the family herd or their separate herds, as the
case may be, must be to them a matter of importance.
Standing on the threshold of the house from the four
corners of which the slayer has gathered a handful of
earth, he throws it over the representatives of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
paternal and maternal kindred. He has done his part,
and now the responsibility rests on them.</p>

<p>The vagueness and difficulty of the next clause
result from a text which has probably been tampered
with. But with the help of Tit. LXII. and the addition
of Tit. CI., giving further details, it becomes at least
partly intelligible. The rule that the payment of
wergeld was made by the relatives in the same proportions
as they would receive it, if one of their kinsmen
had been slain, is so general that we may fairly assume
that it was followed also by the Salic Franks. We
have seen that according to these clauses, if a father
was killed, the sons took the first half of the wergeld,
and that the other half was divided between three
sets of <i>proximiores</i>&mdash;the three parentillæ or sets of
relatives of both paternal and maternal kindreds&mdash;in
certain proportions. The slayer and his sons should
pay the first half, and his father and brothers apparently
help them to pay it. The other part ought to
fall upon the three parentillæ nearest of kin on both
the paternal and maternal side.</p>

<p>So that Clause 3 becomes partly intelligible. ‘If
the father and brothers have already paid’ what the
slayer could not pay of the first half, the earth has
to be thrown upon the three parentillæ nearest of kin
of the mother’s kindred and the three parentillæ
nearest of kin of the father’s kindred. These seem
to be the ‘proximiores’ who should pay the other
half.</p>

<p>The phraseology of the titles LXII. and CI. and the
analogy of other tribal custom seem to warrant the
conclusion that here also the <i>three proximiores</i> on
the paternal and the maternal side were originally not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
three persons next of kin, but the three <i>parentillæ</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
according to Brunner, the descendants of the grandparents,
the great-grandparents, and the great-great-grandparents
of the slayer on both the paternal and
maternal sides.</p>

<p>The next clause is the one which bears clearest
marks of having been tampered with. It makes no
sense when strictly construed, but it seems to
contain two ideas: first that there may be a deficiency
as regards the second half of the payment, and
secondly that the persons who ought to make it up
are ‘<i>those others who come of the paternal kindred</i>.’</p>

<p>The question who are intended by these words is
one not easily answered decisively. Nor is it one
upon which we need to dwell. It is to be regretted,
however, that at this critical point the text is so
sadly confused. For it must be borne in mind that
if no relative was liable beyond those included in the
phrase ‘the three proximiores’ then the liability to
pay and receive wergeld under Salic custom was
restricted to the descendants of the paternal and
maternal great-great-grandparents. And whether it
was so in ancient custom is just what we should like
to know.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Having
cast the
responsibility
upon his
kindred,
the slayer
leaps over
the fence.</div>

<p>Be this as it may, the slayer has done what he
could in throwing the responsibility upon his kindred.
He knows not, perhaps, whether they will fulfil the
obligation thus cast upon them. He has given up
everything he himself possessed, and now, in his shirt,
ungirded, and unshod, he leaps over the fence of the
enclosure with a stake (‘palus’) in hand, to wander
about in suspense until it transpires whether the rest
of the wergeld will be found or not: whether those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
who ought to assist him, whoever they may be, will
help him in his need.</p>

<p>Clause 5 seems to state merely that the liability
of the ‘proximiores’ is collective and not individual,
so that the poorer in each group of relatives are to
be assisted by the richer, and we need not dwell
upon it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">If his
kindred do
not pay,
the slayer
pays with
his life.</div>

<p>Lastly, Clause 6 brings the slayer, after all his
efforts and appeals to his kindred, face to face with
the final result. Four successive times his co-swearers
have brought him up to the mallus to hold him to
his faith, and now at last, if no one steps in to complete
payment of the wergeld, he must pay with his life.</p>

<p>This is the best we can make of the famous title
in the Lex Salica regarding the payment of wergeld.
But perhaps it is enough when taken together with
the clauses relating to its receipt to reveal the main
points of early Salic tribal custom. We may state
them thus:&mdash;(1) That the wergeld was divided into
two halves, for one of which the slayer, helped by
his father and brothers, was responsible, and for the
other of which the three grades of kindred, extending
apparently to the descendants of great-great-grandparents,
were responsible. (2) That if the addition
of Tit. CI. in this respect represented ancient tribal
custom, the payments, like the receipts, of the second
half, were so distributed that the nearer parentilla or
group of relatives paid and received, in relation to
those behind them in kinship, in the proportion of two
thirds and one third. (3) That, if we may take the
addition of Tit. CI. as giving a share to the <i>widow</i>,
and as an innovation, then it may fairly be concluded
that, under ancient Salic custom as under Cymric custom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the widow originally took no share in the wergeld
of her husband, not being a blood relation to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position
of the wife
and her
kindred.</div>

<p>Further, as in the title <i>De chrenecruda</i> there
is no mention of any share in the <i>payment</i> of wergeld
falling upon the wife of the murderer or her
family, we may conclude that however closely two
families might be united by a marriage, the wife, for
the purpose of wergeld, still belonged to her own
kindred, and that marriage did not involve the two
families in mutual obligations for each other’s crimes
of homicide, until both paternal and maternal
kindreds became sharers in payment and receipt of
wergelds in the case of the children of the marriage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What
became of
the
slayer’s
rights in
the land.</div>

<p>It is not needful to follow the speculations of various
authorities as to what became of the homestead and
landed rights abandoned by the slayer when he threw
the chrenecruda upon his kindred and leaped, ungirt
and unshod, over the fence of the inclosure. It is
begging the question to call it his <i>Grundstück</i> in the
sense of a plot of land individually owned. Whether
it was so, or whether under Salic custom land was held
by family groups, as in the case of the Cymric gwely,
is what the clause <i>De chrenecruda</i> does not tell us. The
question may perhaps have easily solved itself. The
homestead and grazing rights, under tribal custom,
might probably simply merge and sink into the
common rights of the kindred, <i>i.e.</i> the neighbouring
kinsmen would get the benefit of them. Even if
the slayer, now himself slain or an exile, had held
a privileged or official position as chief of his family,
it would not follow that his successor (having doubtless
already a homestead of his own) would care to
succeed to the one left vacant. It is much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
likely that tribal superstition would leave the murderer’s
homestead to decay. Even the sons of a person,
whose kindred had left him to perish by refusing the
necessary help in the payment of the wergeld of his
victim, might well refuse to ‘uncover’ the haunted
hearth of their father, whilst if the wergeld were
paid the slayer would return to his old homestead.
Finally it must be remembered that in the tribal
stage of land occupation the value of land itself bore
a very small proportion to the value of the cattle
upon it. And so the ‘Grundstück’ of the slayer
would be as nothing compared with the value of
the hundred cows of a normal wergeld.</p>

<h3>II. THE DIVISION OF CLASSES AS SHOWN BY THE AMOUNT
OF THE WERGELD.</h3>

<p>Turning now to the amount of the wergeld, something
may be learned of the division of classes under
the Lex Salica.</p>

<p>Tit. XLI. fixes the amount of the wergeld of the
typical freeman who is described as ‘the Frank or the
barbarian man who lives under the Lex Salica.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
wergeld of
the freeman
living
under
Salic law
200 solidi.</div>

<p>The amount, as throughout the Lex are all the
payments, is stated in so many denarii and so many
solidi&mdash;8,000 denarii, <i>i.e.</i> 200 solidi. And that the
Frank or barbarian living under the Lex Salica was
the typical freeman is shown by the title <i>De debilitatibus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
which fixes the payment for the destruction
of an eye, hand, or foot at 100 solidi. Half the wergeld
is the highest payment for eye, hand, and foot
ever exacted by the Continental laws, and 100 solidi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
certainly cannot apply to any grade of persons with a
lower wergeld than 200 solidi.</p>

<p>Tit. XLI. is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si quis ingenuo franco aut
barbarum, qui legem Salega vivit,
occiderit, cui fuerit adprobatum
viii. <i>M.</i> den. qui fac. sol. cc. culp.
jud.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If any one shall kill a freeman&mdash;a
Frank or barbarian man who
lives under the Lex Salica&mdash;let
him whose guilt is proved be
judged to be liable for viii. M.
denarii, which make cc. solidi.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>As this clause probably dates before the issue of
Merovingian solidi of diminished weight, the 200 solidi
of the wergeld may be taken to have been at the
date of the law 200 gold solidi of Imperial standard.</p>

<p>So that the wergeld of the Frank or the free
‘barbarus living under the Lex Salica’ originally, when
paid in gold solidi, was neither more nor less than
the normal wergeld of a heavy gold mina.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Officials
had a
triple
wergeld.</div>

<p>We learn from clause 2 of the same title that if
the homicide was aggravated by concealment of the
corpse the composition was increased to 24,000 denarii
or 600 solidi, and that the wergeld of a person ‘in
truste dominica’ was again 600 solidi. The Royal
Official thus, as in several other laws, had a triple
wergeld.</p>

<p>Then lastly under the same title are three clauses
describing the wergelds of the ‘Romanus homo conviva
Regis,’ as 300 solidi, of the ‘Romanus homo
possessor’ as 100 solidi, and of the ‘Romanus tributarius’
in some texts 45, and in others 63, 70, and 120
solidi. In Codex 10 the ‘Romanus possessor’ is
described as the man who in the pagus in which he
lives <i>res proprias possidet</i>.</p>

<p>The natural inference from these lesser wergelds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
is that the Gallo-Romans were not ‘living under the
Lex Salica,’ but under their own Gallo-Roman law,
with wergelds one half the amount of those of the
Frankish freemen.</p>

<p>Another of the 65 titles, viz. LIV., gives a further
set of wergelds. The wergeld of a <i>grafio</i> is to be
600 solidi, that of a <i>sacebaro</i> or <i>ob-grafio</i> who is a
<i>puer regis</i> 300 solidi, and that of a <i>sacebaro</i> who is an
<i>ingenuus</i> 600 solidi. The <i>sacebaro</i> was apparently
the lowest in rank of judicial officials except the
<i>rachinburgus</i>, and the clause adds that there ought
not to be more than three sacebarones in each
malberg.</p>

<p>We may conclude from these statements that, the
wergeld of the freeman living under the Lex Salica
being 200 gold solidi, the higher wergelds up to
600 solidi were the threefold wergelds of public
officials, <i>i.e.</i> threefold of the wergeld of the class to
which they belonged. The wergeld of the sacebaro
who was a <i>puer regis</i> was three times that of the
Romanus possessor. The sacebaro who was an
<i>ingenuus</i> had a wergeld three times that of the
ingenuus living under Salic law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strangers
in blood
had only
half
wergelds
<i>Romanus
possessor</i>
100 solidi.</div>

<p>We are thus brought into contact with an interesting
question. These laws, made after conquest and
settlement on once Roman ground, ought to be good
evidence upon the tribal method of dealing with
strangers in blood: <i>i.e.</i>, in this case, the Gallo-Roman
conquered population. And these clauses seem to
show that half wergelds only were awarded to them
under Salic law.</p>

<p>M. Fustel de Coulanges held indeed the opinion
that the term ‘Romanus’ of the laws was confined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the <i>freedman</i> who had been emancipated by process
of Roman law.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> But here the contrast seems to me
to be between Franks and barbarians ‘who live under
Salic law’ on the one hand, and the Gallo-Romans,
whether freedmen or Roman possessores, living under
Roman law on the other hand. We shall come upon
this question again when the Ripuarian laws are
examined, and need not dwell upon it here.</p>

<p>It is interesting, however, to notice that in Codex 2,
Tit. XLI. the Malberg gloss on the clause regarding
the wergeld of the ‘<i>Romanus tributarius</i>’ is ‘<i>uuala
leodi</i>,’ which Kern (208) explains to mean the wergeld
of a <i>Wala</i>&mdash;the well-known name given by Teutonic
people to their Gallo-Roman and Romanised neighbours.</p>

<h3>III. TRIBAL RULES OF SUCCESSION IN ‘TERRA SALICA.’</h3>

<p>The question of the payment of wergeld is now
generally admitted to be distinct from that of
inheritance in land.</p>

<p>The persons who receive and pay their share of
the wergeld are those who would have taken part
directly or indirectly in the feud. They are not
confined to the expectant heirs of the slayer or the
slain.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>If we are to learn anything directly upon the
question of the method of landholding under Salic
custom it must be, not from the clauses relating
to the wergelds, but mainly from the Title LIX.
<i>De Alodis</i>. It is the next title to the <i>De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
chrenecruda</i> and can hardly be passed by without
some attempt to recognise the bearing of its clauses
upon the present inquiry.</p>

<p>Its text is very variously rendered in the several
manuscripts, and it has been the subject of many
interpretations. But if it may be legitimate to approach
it from a strictly tribal point of view, it will
not be difficult, I think, to suggest an interpretation
consistent with what we have learned of tribal custom
from the Cymric example, and therefore worthy at
least of careful consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The title
‘De
Alodis.’</div>

<p>According to Codex 1 of Hessels and Kern the
clauses are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">(1) Si quis mortuus fuerit et
filios non demiserit, si mater sua

not have left sons, if his mother
shall have survived let her succeed

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">(2) Si mater non fuerit et
fratrem aut sororem dimiserit,
ipsi in hereditatem succedant.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If the mother shall not be

left brother or sister, let them
succeed to the inheritance.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">(3) Tunc si ipsi non fuerint,
soror matris in hereditatem
succedat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Then, if they shall not be
[surviving], let the sister of the
mother succeed to the inheritance.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">(4) Et inde de illis generationibus
quicunque proximior fuerit,
ille in hereditatem succedat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">And further concerning these
generations, whichever shall be
the nearer, let it succeed to the
inheritance.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">(5) De terra vero nulla in
muliere hereditas non pertinebit,
sed ad virilem secum (leg. <i>sexum</i>)

<p class="lang2of2">But concerning <i>land</i> no inheritance
shall pertain to a woman,
but to the male sex who shall be
brothers let the whole land pertain.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The last clause in Codex 10 (Herold’s) is amplified
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">(5) De terra vero Salica in
mulierem nulla portio hæreditatis
transit, sed hoc virilis sexus
acqviret: hoc est, filii in ipsa
hæreditate succedunt. Sed ubi
inter <i>nepotes aut pronepotes</i> post
longum tempus de alode terræ
contentio suscitatur, non per
stirpes sed per capita dividantur.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Concerning, however, <i>terra
Salica</i>, let no portion of the
inheritance pass to a woman, but let
the male sex acquire it: <i>i.e.</i> sons
succeed to that inheritance. But
where after a long time dispute may
arise between <i>grandsons</i> or <i>great-grandsons</i>
concerning the alod of
land, let the division be not <i>per
stirpes</i>, but <i>per capita</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
‘alod’
embraced
the whole
inheritance&mdash;land
and
cattle, &amp;c.</div>

<p>Now, in the first place, what is meant by the
term <i>alod</i>? In the Lex Salica it occurs again in
Tit. XCIX. <i>De rebus in alode patris</i>, which relates to
a dispute about the right to a certain thing, as to
which the decision turns upon the proof that can be
given by the defendant that he acquired the thing
<i>in alode patris</i>. He has to bring three witnesses to
prove ‘<i>quod in alode patris hoc invenisset</i>,’ and three
more witnesses to prove ‘<i>qualiter pater suus res
ipsas invenisset</i>,’ and if after failure of proof and the
interdiction of the law the thing be found in his
possession he is to be fined <span class="smcapuc">XXXV.</span> solidi.</p>

<p>From this clause the inference must apparently be
that the ‘<i>alod</i> of the father’ was the whole bundle
of rights and possessions, personal as well as real,
which passed to descendants by inheritance. Indeed,
it seems to be generally admitted that in the title ‘de
alodis’ all the clauses except the last apply to
personal property, and only the last to realty.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">It was an
ancestral
family
inheritance.</div>

<p>There are titles ‘de alodibus’ both in the Ripuarian
Law<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and in that of the ‘Anglii and Werini.’<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
In both laws the ‘alod’ includes personalty, and the
latter defines the personalty as ‘<i>pecunia</i> et <i>mancipia</i>,’
thus reminding us that the personalty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
alod mainly consisted of cattle and slaves. In the
title ‘de alodibus’ of the Ripuarian Law, the hereditary
or ancestral character of the alod is emphasised
by the application to it of the words ‘hereditas
<i>aviatica</i>’ There may, however, be some doubt
whether the term <i>hereditas aviatica</i> included the
whole alod or only the land of the alod.</p>

<p>Regarding, therefore, the ‘alod’ as in some sense
a bundle of rights and property, let us try to consider
these clauses with a fresh mind in the light of
what we have learned of Cymric tribal custom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
position
of females
and
modifications
made in
their
favour.</div>

<p>Under this custom, speaking broadly, as we have
seen, daughters did not share in the landed rights of
the gwely. They received instead of landed rights
in the gwely their <i>gwaddol</i> or portion, mostly, no
doubt, in cattle, and they were supposed with it to
marry into another gwely, in whose landed rights
their sons were expected to share by paternity. If
women inherited landed rights at all, it was exceptionally
in the case of failure of male heirs, and then
only so that their <i>sons</i> might inherit. The heiress in
such a case, under Cymric as well as Greek tribal
law, was in quite an exceptional position, and, as we
have seen in Beowulf, the sister’s son might be called
back into the mother’s family to prevent its failure
for want of heirs.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The exclusion of female successors
from terra Salica is therefore quite in accordance with
tribal custom.</p>

<p>That the clauses as to personalty in the ‘de alodis ’
were modifications of ancient Salic custom, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in favour of females, is rendered almost certain by
the position of the last clause as a saving clause,
apparently inserted with the object of protecting the
rights of the sons in the land of the alod, by preventing
the application to it of the previous clauses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The land
of the alod
was <i>terra</i>.</div>

<p>Codex 1 does not describe the land as <i>terra Salica</i>.
It is content to protect <i>land</i> without qualification
from the application of the previous clauses, which, if
applied to land, would transgress against tribal
custom. And the same may be said of Codices 3
and 4. But in the Codices 5 to 10 and in the ‘Lex
emendata’ the words ‘terra Salica’ are used.</p>

<p>This is a point of importance, because it goes far
to show that the whole of the land of the alod was
terra Salica, and protected by the saving clause from
participation by females. The use of the word <i>land</i>
alone in Codex 1 forbids our thinking that part
of the land of the alod was terra Salica and the rest
not terra Salica.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> And this consideration seems to
show that to import into the clause any explanation
of the term derived from the word <i>Sala</i>, so as to confine
its meaning to the ‘<i>Haus und Hofland</i>’ or the
‘<i>Väterliches Wohnhaus</i>,’ as Amira<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and Lamprecht<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
would do, would be misleading. The homestead
of the chief of a tribal family holding, on terra
Salica, may, like the Roman villa, have passed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
various and even natural stages into the ‘<i>Herrengut</i>,’ or
‘<i>terra indominicata</i>’ of later manorial phraseology, and
the term <i>terra Salica</i> may have clung, as it were, to it.
But to reason backwards to the Lex Salica from the
instances of its later use, given by Guérard in his
sections on the subject, seems in this case, if I may
venture to say so, to be a reversal of the right order
of inference. Lamprecht carefully guards himself
against the view that the <i>terra Salica</i> of the Lex was
as yet a ‘Herrengut,’ and Guérard, in his careful
sections on the subject, admits three stages in the
evolution of the <i>terra Salica</i>: (1) ‘l’enceinte dépendant
de la maison du Germain;’ (2) ‘la terre du manse
seigneurial;’ (3) ‘simplement la terre possédée en
propre, quelquefois donnée en tenure.’<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>This may in some sense fairly represent the line
of evolution subsequently followed, and I have long
ago recognised the embryo manor in the ‘Germania’
of Tacitus; but, for our present purpose, this does not
seem to help to an understanding of the term as used
in the Lex Salica.</p>

<p>When all the Codices are taken together into
account, <i>terra Salica</i> seems to include the whole of
the land, or landed rights, of the alod. From the whole,
and not only the chief homestead, the succession of
females is excluded, and it is the whole, and not the
chief homestead only, which is to be divided between
the nepotes and pronepotes of the deceased tribesman.</p>

<p>Approaching the Lex Salica, as we are doing, from
a tribal point of view, we seem to get upon quite other
and simpler ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Terra
Salica</i>
was land
held
under the
rules of
the Lex
Salica and
subject
ultimately
to division
<i>per capita</i>
between
great-grandchildren.</div>

<p>The emphasis laid in the Lex Salica upon the
distinction in social status between persons ‘living
under the Lex Salica’ and those living under Roman
law suggests that <i>land</i> held under the Lex Salica was
not held under the same rules as those under which the
‘Romanus possessor’ held his ‘res propria.’ It would
seem natural, then, that <i>terra Salica</i> should be land
held under Salic custom as opposed to land held under
Roman law. And if this be the simple rendering of
the term <i>terra Salica</i> in the Lex, then returning to the
likeness of the Salic ‘alod’ to the Cymric family
holding some likeness might be expected in the rules of
succession to the land of the alod when compared with
the Cymric rules of succession to the ‘tir gweliauc’ or
family land of the gwely.</p>

<p>We have seen that in the gwely the descendants
of a common great-grandfather were kept together as
a family group till, after internal divisions between
brothers and then between cousins, there was at
last equal division of landed rights between second
cousins, <i>i.e.</i> great-grandsons of the original head of
the gwely. The fact of this right of redivision at
last between great-grandchildren was apparently
what held the family group together till the third
generation.</p>

<p>The last clause of the ‘de alodis,’ even as it stands
in Codex 1, coincides with Cymric custom in so far as
it excludes females from landed rights and confines
inheritance in the land of the alod in the first instance
to <i>sons</i> ‘… <i>qui fratres fuerint</i>.’</p>

<p>And when at last later Codices call the land of the
alod <i>terra Salica</i>, and the addition in Codex 10 is
taken into account, the evidence becomes very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
indeed that under Salic custom the land of the alod
or terra Salica was held as a family holding, and, like
the land of the gwely, divisible, first between sons,
then between grandsons, and at last between great-grandsons.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But when among grandsons or great-grandsons contention
arises, after long time, concerning the alod of land, they [the
lands of the alod] should be divided, not <i>per stirpes</i>, but <i>per
capita</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The later the date at which this sentence was
added to the final clause of the ‘de alodis,’ the
stronger becomes the evidence of what ancient Salic
custom on this matter was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The final
clause
protects
the family
holding.</div>

<p>Assuredly the object of these words is not to
introduce a new principle. They obviously describe
ancient Salic custom in order to protect it. And
how could a division <i>per capita</i> amongst great-grandsons
take place unless, as in the Cymric gwely,
the holding of terra Salica had during the whole
period of the three generations been kept in some
sense together as a family holding?</p>

<p>It would be unwise to press analogies between
Cymric and Salic tribal custom too far, but I have
before pointed out that a system of wergelds, to
which paternal and maternal relatives each individually
contributed their share, seems to imply an
original solidarity of kindred, which must, wherever
it was fully in force, have been connected with a
corresponding solidarity in the occupation of land,
together with its complement, an individual ownership
of cattle. And in the light of the ‘de alodis’ it
does not seem unlikely that it may have been so under
ancient Salic custom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction
between
land
under
Salic and
land
under
Roman
law.</div>

<p>If the foregoing considerations be accepted, may
we not recognise in the term <i>terra Salica</i>, as at first
used, a meaning analogous to that which Professor
Vinogradoff has recently so brilliantly given to the
Anglo-Saxon term ‘folc-land’?<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In both cases surely
it was natural that there should be a term distinguishing
land still held under the rules of ancient
tribal custom from land held under the Romanised
rules of individual landownership.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to do more than allude here to
the various clauses of the Lex Salica from which the
existence of individual holdings is clearly to be inferred.
If, from this single mention of <i>terra Salica</i>
and its ultimate division among great-grandsons
<i>per capita</i>, the continued existence of tribal or family
holdings held still under Salic law may be legitimately
inferred, it is at least equally clear that the <i>Romanus
possessor</i> who lived and held his possession as <i>res
propria</i> under Roman law also existed. And if so the
two classes of holders of land must often have been
neighbours. The vicini, ‘qui in villa consistunt,’ of
the title ‘de migrantibus’ (XLV.) may some of them
have been of the one class and some of them of the
other. The objection of a single person living
under Salic law to the interloper would have a
new meaning and become very natural if the conflict
between the two systems were involved. And
when we have reminded ourselves of these facts the
title <i>De eum qui se de parentilla tollere vult</i>, to which
allusion has already been made, which enabled the
tribesman, by the somewhat theatrical action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
breaking the four sticks of alder over his head, to
cut himself loose from his parentilla, takes its proper
place as evidence of the temptation which must have
beset the young tribesman in close contact with Gallo-Roman
neighbours to free himself from what had
come to be regarded as a bondage, and to take an
independent position as an individual under the
new order of things which was fast undermining the
old.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Edict of
Chilperic
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 561-584.</div>

<p>Besides the title ‘de alodis’ there is another
source of information which must not be overlooked&mdash;viz.
the Edict of Chilperic (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 561-584).<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>This edict appears to have been issued soon
after the extension of the Frankish boundary from
the Loire to the Garonne, and specially to apply to
the newly conquered district.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Admission
of female
succession
to prevent
Salic land
from
passing
from the
family
group to
strangers.</div>

<p>This conquest would necessarily extend the area
within which Salic settlements would be made
among non-Salic neighbours, and multiply the cases in
which even a Salic Frank might find himself less
securely surrounded by kinsmen than of old. Under
these altered circumstances instances would become
more and more frequent of the close neighbourhood
of tribesmen still holding under Salic custom and
strangers living under Roman laws of succession.
The clauses of the edict seem accordingly to be
directly intended to prevent lapsed interests of Salic
tribesmen in land from falling to the vicini when
there were brothers or female relations surviving.
In old times in purely Salic settlements lapsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
interests must usually have become merged in the
general rights of the kindred, the vicini being kinsmen.
And no harm might come of it. Landed rights
would seldom have passed away from the kindred.
But as the stranger element increased in prominence
the kindreds would more and more suffer loss.
Hence probably the extended rights given by the
edict to female relatives. It allows them to succeed
in certain cases so as to prevent the land, or, as we
should rather say, the landed rights, from lapsing to
the vicini.</p>

<p>Clause 3 is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Simili modo placuit atque
convenit, ut si quicumque vicinos
habens aut filios aut filias post
obitum suum superstitutus fuerit,
quamdiu filii advixerint terra
habeant, sicut et Lex Salica
habet.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Likewise we will and declare
that if any one having <i>vicini</i>,
or sons or daughters, shall be
succeeded to after his death, so
long as the sons live let them
have the land as the Lex Salica
provides.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>So far evidently no change is made; old custom
still holds good. But in the rest of the clauses a
modification is made evidently to meet altered circumstances,
and specially to shut out the <i>vicini</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Et si subito filii defuncti
fuerint, filia simili modo accipiat
terras ipsas, sicut et filii si vivi
fuissent aut habuissent. Et si
moritur, frater alter superstitutus
fuerit, frater terras accipiat, <i>non
vicini</i>. Et subito frater moriens
frater non derelinquerit superstitem,
tunc soror ad terra ipsa
accedat possidenda.…</p>

<p class="lang2of2">And if suddenly the sons
shall have died let the daughter
receive those lands as the sons
would have done had they been
alive. And if he [a brother] should
die and another brother should
survive, let the brother receive
those lands, <i>not the vicini</i>. And
if suddenly the brother shall die
not leaving a brother surviving,
then let a sister succeed to the
possession of that land.…</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The remainder of the clause is very difficult to
construe in the imperfect state of the text, and it is
not necessary to dwell upon it. It seems to apply
to newcomers (‘qui adveniunt’) and their rights
<i>inter se</i>.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>We have then in these clauses an allusion to
ancient tribal custom as well as to the change made
necessary by the new circumstances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analogy
of Cymric
custom.</div>

<p>The implication is that under the rule of ancient
custom, on a brother’s death without children, <i>his
brothers did not succeed to his land, but the vicini</i>.
Now the brother is to succeed, <i>not the vicini</i>.</p>

<p>At first sight this seems unnatural and unlikely.
But it ceases to be so if we may regard the alod of terra
Salica as a family holding under conditions somewhat
like those of the gwely. For under Cymric custom
the brother did not succeed to the childless brother
as his heir. The co-inheritors, as far as second
cousins, were his heirs. In other words the lapsed
share went to his <i>vicini</i>, but they were the kinsmen
of his own gwely.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Nor did a brother succeed to his brother’s <i>da</i>, and
the grazing rights and homestead connected with it.
He had received this <i>da</i>, as we have seen, from
his chief of kindred by ‘kin and descent,’ <i>i.e.</i> by
tribal right in his kindred, and therefore if he should
die without children his <i>da</i> and everything he had by
kin and descent went, not to his brothers, but back to
the kindred or the chief of kindred from whom he received
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the son die after 14 years of age and leave no heir, his
‘argluyd’ is to possess all his <i>da</i> and to be in place of a son
to him and his house becomes a dead-house. (<i>Ven. Code</i>, i.
p. 203.)<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The lapse of landed rights in family holdings to
the kindred was one thing. Their passing out of the
kindred to vicini who were strangers would be quite
another thing.</p>

<p>When after a time, let us say under cover of the
title ‘de migrantibus’ or upon extended conquests,
others, perhaps ‘Romani possessores,’ had taken
places in the villa side by side with the tribesmen
living under the customary rules of <i>terra Salica</i>, or
when Salic Franks had settled among strangers, the
new element would have to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>In the clause ‘de migrantibus’ the protection of
ancient Salic custom was sought by the exclusion of
strangers at the instance of a single objector from
terra Salica. In the Edict of Chilperic, on the other
hand, the presence of stranger vicini was taken for
granted, and the protection of terra Salica sought
by extending the right of succession to brothers
and females, so that at least fewer cases might
arise of lapsed inheritances falling away from the
kindred into the hands of the <i>vicini</i> who might be
strangers.</p>

<p>The breaking up of tribal custom thus was not
all at once, but by steps. At first <i>terra Salica</i> was
limited to men, then female succession was allowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and lastly, in default of kindred, stranger vicini
under certain conditions were admitted to the lapsed
inheritance.</p>

<h3>IV. THE WERGELDS AND DIVISION OF CLASSES IN THE
‘LEX RIPUARIORUM.’</h3>

<p>The customs of the Ripuarian Franks as to wergelds,
as might be expected, do not seem to have
varied much from those of the Salic Franks. They
were probably neighbours in close contact with each
other, and, judging from the laws, the population of
the district was a mixed one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld
of freeman
as under
the Lex
Salica,
200 gold
solidi.
That
of the
official
threefold.</div>

<p>The wergeld of the Ripuarian ingenuus, like that
of the Salic Frank or barbarian living under the Lex
Salica, was 200 gold solidi, and 12 co-swearers were
required to deny the homicide (Tit. VII.).</p>

<p>Here again official position seems, as under the
Salic law, to be protected by a triple wergeld. The
<i>grafio</i> or <i>comes</i>, who was a fiscal judge, had a wergeld
of 600 solidi (Tit. LIII.). The payment for one
<i>in truste regis</i> was also 600 solidi (Tit. XI.).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the wergeld of a ‘<i>homo regis</i>’
(Tit. IX.), like that of the ‘<i>puer regis</i>’ of the Salic
law, was only 100 solidi, and that of the ‘man’ of the
Church the same (Tit. X.), <i>i.e.</i> half that of the Ripuarian
ingenuus.</p>

<p>Consistently with this, the triple payment for
killing a woman between childbearing and 40, as also
in the Salic Law, was 600 solidi, whilst the wergeld
of the ‘femina regia’ or ‘ecclesiastica’ was only 300
solidi.</p>

<p>There are apparently hardly any indications as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
how or to whom the wergelds were to be paid. There
is only one reference to the <i>parentes</i>, and that is not
connected with the wergelds. In Tit. LXXXV. it is stated
that he who shall disinter a corpse and rob it
shall pay 200 solidi and be ‘expelled till he shall
satisfy the <i>parentes</i>.’</p>

<p>The murderer alone seems to be responsible, unless
indeed the few words added to the clauses imposing
the triple wergeld of 600 solidi upon the murderer of
a woman may be taken to be of general application.
The words are these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘If the murderer shall be poor, so that he cannot pay at once,
then let him pay <i>per tres decessiones filiorum</i>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Has it really come to this, that since the Edict of
Childeric II. came into force the parentes are released,
and the descendants of the murderer, for three generations,
are to be in slavery till the wergeld is paid? It
may be so, for the penalty in default of payment of
the wergeld probably included his own slavery, which
involved with it that of his descendants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fisc
gradually
takes the
place of
the kindred.</div>

<p>The ancient tribal tradition that within the family
there could be no feud or wergeld, but exile only, was
still apparently in force. In Title LXIX. there is a
clause which enacts that if any one shall slay one next
in kin (‘proximus sanguinis’) he shall suffer exile and
all his goods shall go to the fisc. This exile of the
slayer of a near kinsman and forfeiture of his goods
to the fisc seems to be almost the only distinct
important survival of tribal feeling, apparently
neither wergeld nor the death of the slayer being
admitted. But in this case the fisc was, as usual, the
gainer. Parricide under any system of criminal law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
would be a capital crime. The pertinacity with
which the custom that, being a crime <i>within</i> the
kindred, there could be no feud and therefore no
wergeld, was adhered to in the midst of manifold
changes in circumstances, feeling, and law, is very
remarkable.</p>

<p>There is not much else in the Ripuarian laws
throwing light upon tribal customs as regards the
solidarity of the kindred. But there is a good deal of
interesting information upon the important subject of
the treatment of strangers in blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction
between
persons
living
under
Salic law
and those
living
under
Roman
law who
were
treated as
strangers
in blood.</div>

<p>We have seen that in the Lex Salica the definition
of the <i>ingenuus</i> with a wergeld of 200 solidi was
the <i>Francus</i> or <i>barbarus</i> living under Salic law.
The ‘barbarus’ who lived under Salic law was no
longer a stranger; he had in fact become a Frank.
As we should say, he had been <i>naturalised</i>. Hence
there was no inconsistency in the apparent occasional
indiscriminate use of the words ‘Francus’ and
‘ingenuus.’ They meant the same thing. But there
is nothing to show that the ordinary Gallo-Roman
was included under the term ‘<i>barbarus</i> who lived
under Salic law.’ On the other hand, we find him
living under the Roman law.</p>

<p>In considering the method of dealing with people
of so mixed a population as that of the Ripuarian
district it is very important to recognise how, under
tribal custom, every man continued to live under the
law under which he was born, until by some legal
process his nationality, so to speak, was admitted to
be changed. The Cymric example has shown us how
strictly the tribal blood and admission from outside
into the tribe were guarded. In such a mixed population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as that of the Ripuarian district, the strictness
may have been somewhat relaxed, and the formalities
of admission less difficult. But there is evidence
enough, I think (with great deference to M. Fustel de
Coulanges’ doubts on the subject), to show that to
some extent at any rate social distinctions were still
founded upon ‘difference of blood.’ At all events
it is worth while to examine the additional evidence
afforded by some clauses in the Ripuarian laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strangers
of allied
tribes have
wergelds
according
to the law
of their
birth, but
if they
cannot

ordeal.</div>

<p>In Tit. XXXI. it is stated that Franks, Burgundians,
Alamanni, and others, of whatever nation,
living in the Ripuarian country, are to be judged and
dealt with, if guilty, according to the law of the place
of their birth, and not by the Ripuarian law, and
it is significantly added that (living away from their
kinsmen as they often must be) if they cannot find
compurgators they must clear themselves by the
ordeal of ‘fire or lot.’<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Here we come upon one of the strongest tests of
tribal custom in its insistence upon the necessity of
a man being surrounded by a kindred before he can
be a fully recognised tribesman. Unless he be
surrounded by kinsmen who can swear for him, under
tribal custom, he must have recourse to the ordeal in
case of any criminal charge.</p>

<p>There is a clause, not inconsistent, I think, with
Tit. XXXI., which seems to draw a clear distinction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
favour of tribes more or less nearly allied in blood with
Franks, viz. the Burgundians, Alamanni, Bavarians,
Saxons, and Frisians, resident in the Ripuarian district,
as contrasted with the <i>Romanus</i>, who surely must be
the Gallo-Roman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld
of the
<i>Romanus</i>
100 solidi
instead of
200 or
160 solidi.</div>

<p>Thus the Roman stranger is placed in the lowest
grade. His wergeld is only 100 solidi&mdash;half that of
the Ripuarian or Salic Frank&mdash;whilst those tribes
nearer in blood to the Frank are classed together with
a wergeld of 160 solidi, not much less than that of
the Frank. Indeed, there is reason to believe that
these were the wergelds of the several tribes in
force in their own country according to their
own laws.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>In this connection the view of M. Fustel de Coulanges,
that the term ‘Romanus’ is confined to the
libertus freed under Roman law, hardly seems natural.
The evidence seems to show that the man freed under
the formalities of Frankish law thenceforth lived under
Salic law and became a Frankish freeman with a
freeman’s wergeld of 200 solidi, whilst the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
became a freedman under process of Roman law
thenceforth lived under Roman law, and became a
Roman freeman&mdash;a Romanus&mdash;with a wergeld of
only 100 solidi. The inference that the difference
in status was the result of difference in blood is
not altered by the fact that the social status awarded
to the Gallo-Roman was the same as that of the
libertus in some other laws.</p>

<p>The fact relied upon by M. Fustel de Coulanges,
that under the laws of the Burgundians and the
Wisigoths the Gallo-Roman was placed in a position
of equality with the Teutonic conquerors, need not,
I think, affect the view to be taken of his position
under the Salic and Ripuarian laws. Tribal custom
had to meet in Burgundy and the Wisigothic district
with Roman law and Roman institutions still comparatively
in their full strength. Marriages with the
Gallo-Roman population were encouraged, and the
system of wergelds almost entirely superseded. The
Frankish conquest was of another kind, and the
Frank was hardly likely to care to meet the Gallo-Roman
on equal terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position
of the
freedman
or <i>denarialis</i>
under
Frankish
law. His
wergeld
200 solidi.</div>

<p>Passing now from the position of the stranger
who was recognised as a freeman, let us try to get
a clear idea of the position of the <i>freedman</i> under
the Ripuarian law, taking the cases of the Frankish
freedman and the Roman libertus separately.</p>

<p>In Tit. VIII. the payment for slaying a <i>servus</i> is
36 solidi. In Tit. LXII., if any one makes his servus
into a <i>tributarius</i> or a <i>litus</i> and he is killed, the
penalty is the same&mdash;36 solidi, but if he chooses to
make him into a <i>denarialis</i> (<i>i.e.</i> a freedman under
Frankish law) then his value shall be 200 solidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>The tributarius or litus has gained but one step
up the ladder of Frankish freedom. But the denarialis,
with nearly six times his wergeld, has as
regards his wergeld reached the highest rung at a
single leap.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But till
he has
a free
kindred,
if he has
no children
the
fisc is his
heir.</div>

<p>Though, however, as regards wergeld he has done
so, in another sense he has by no means done so.
Under tribal custom he would not attain to full tribal
rights till a kindred had grown up around him. So
under Tit. LVII. the ‘homo denarialis,’ notwithstanding
his wergeld of 200 solidi, is recognised as having
no kindred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(s. 4) If a ‘homo denariatus’ shall die without children he leaves
no other heir than our fisc.</p>

</div>

<p>And in full accord with this statement is the
following clause in the ‘Capitulare legi Ripuariæ
additum’ of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 803.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Homo denarialis non ante hæreditare in suam agnationem
poterit quam usque ad terciam generationem perveniat.</p>

</div>

<p>So that more of tribal custom still prevails in his
case than at first appears. Only in the third generation
are full rights of inheritance secured to his successors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld
of the
<i>libertus</i>
under
Roman
law 100
solidi.</div>

<p>If now we turn to the <i>libertus</i> under Roman law,
Tit. LXI. states that if any one shall make his servus
into a libertus and Roman citizen, if he shall commit
a crime he shall be judged by Roman law, and if he
be killed the payment shall be 100 solidi: but ‘if he
shall die without children he shall have no heir but
our fisc.’</p>

<p>Thus, as regards inheritance, the Frankish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
denarialis and the Roman libertus seem to be treated
alike, notwithstanding the difference of wergeld.</p>

<p>Turning to another matter, the Ripuarian laws,
being of later date than the Lex Salica, made provision
for the wergelds of the clergy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds
of the
clergy, and
of their
‘men.’</div>

<p>Tit. XXXVI. provided that the clergy should be
compounded for according to their birth, whether of
the class of servi, or men of the king or of the Church,
or liti, or ingenui. If <i>ingenui</i>, they were to be compounded
for with 200 solidi. Then the wergelds of
the higher clergy are stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values for clergy">
  <tr>
    <td>Subdeacon</td>
    <td>400 solidi</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Deacon</td>
    <td>500 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Priest</td>
    <td>600 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bishop</td>
    <td>900 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And there is a long clause <i>De Tabulariis</i> (Tit.
LVIII.) providing that servi may be made under
process of Roman law <i>tabularii</i> of the Church, so that
they and their descendants shall be and remain
servants of the Church, and render the proper services
of tabularii to the Church, without any one
having power further to enfranchise them. In case
of their death without children the Church is to be
their heir. These appear to be the ‘men of the
Church’ whose wergeld was 100 solidi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
clause ‘De
alodibus.’</div>

<p>The Tit. LVI. <i>De alodibus</i> is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si quis absque liberis defunctus
fuerit, si pater materque superstites
fuerint in hereditatem succedant.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If any one shall have died
without children, if father and
mother survive they shall succeed
to the <i>hereditas</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si pater materque non fuerint,
frater et soror succedant.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If there are not father and
mother, brother and sister shall
succeed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si autem nec eos habuerit,
tunc soror matris patrisque succedant.
Et deinceps usque ad
quintam genuculum, qui proximus
fuerit, hereditatem succedat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">But if he has not these either,
then the sister of the mother and
the sister of the father shall succeed.
And further, up to the fifth
knee, whoever is nearest shall
succeed to the inheritance.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Sed cum virilis sexus extiterit,
femina in hereditatem aviaticam
non succedat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">But as long as the male sex
survive, a woman shall not succeed
to the <i>hereditas aviatica</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>All that need be remarked regarding this title is,
first its close resemblance to the clause ‘de alodis’
in the Lex Salica and the confirmation given by the
phrase ‘hereditas aviatica’ to the family character
of the ‘alod,’ and secondly that it seems to belong
to the time when female succession was favoured.</p>

<p>Whether the ‘hereditas aviatica’ included the
whole alod or only the land of the alod, on failure of
male heirs, females were now to succeed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The traditional
value of
animals
in payment
of
wergelds.
The
wergeld
of 200
solidi =
100 oxen.</div>

<p>There remains only to be noticed the interesting
addition to Tit. XXXVI. which enacts that if any one
ought to pay wergeld he should reckon, <i>inter alia</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>The ox, horned, seeing, and sound, for</td>
    <td>2 solidi</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The cow, horned, seeing, and sound, for [3 or]</td>
    <td>1 solidus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The horse, seeing and sound, for</td>
    <td>6 solidi</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The mare, seeing and sound, for</td>
    <td>3 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And this is followed by a final clause which is
found only in some of the manuscripts and which is
probably an addition made under Charlemagne:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If payment shall be made in silver, let 12 denarii be paid for
the solidus, <i>sicut antiquitus est constitutum</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus our consideration of these laws ends with
the fact that, before the disturbance in the currency
made by Charlemagne, the wergeld of the Frankish
freeman of 200 gold solidi or heavy gold mina was
still, in the Ripuarian district at all events, a normal
wergeld of 100 oxen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h3>V. THE ALAMANNIC AND BAVARIAN LAWS.</h3>

<p>These laws have an interest of their own, but
only those points come directly within the range of
this inquiry which are likely to throw light upon the
interpretation of the Anglo-Saxon laws.</p>

<p>Beginning at once with the wergelds, there are two
distinct statements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
wergelds
of the
early
Alamannic
‘Pactus,’
and of the
later ‘Lex
Hlotharii.’</div>

<p>According to the ‘Pactus,’ which is assigned to
the sixth or seventh century, and which is considered
to represent customs of the Alamanni before they
were conquered by the Franks,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the wergelds were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Baro de mino flidis</td>
    <td>170 solidi (? 160)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medianus Alamannus</td>
    <td>200 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Primus Alamannus</td>
    <td>240 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And for women:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Femina mino flidis</td>
    <td>320 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mediana</td>
    <td>400 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prima Alamanna</td>
    <td>480 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These wergelds correspond very closely in some
points with those of the Burgundian laws and should
be compared with them.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The wergeld of women was double that of men
of the same class. In the Lex Salica and Lex Ripuariorum,
women were paid for threefold.</p>

<p>In the Lex Hlotharii, s. LXIX., the wergelds are
stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If any freeman (‘liber’) kills a freeman, let him compound for
him twice 80 solidi to his sons. If he does not leave sons nor has
heirs let him pay 200 solidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Women of theirs, moreover, always in double.</p>

<p>The medius Alamannus, if he shall be killed, let 200 solidi be
paid to the parentes.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not clear that there has been any change in
the wergelds since the date of the ‘Pactus.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
wergeld of
160 solidi
accords
with the
statement
in the
Ripuarian
law.</div>

<p>The wergeld of the medius Alamannus, 200 solidi,
is the same as before. That of the liber, 160 solidi,
seems to be the same as that of the baro de mino
flidis in the ‘Pactus.’ It is also the wergeld of the
Alamannus according to the clause mentioning
strangers in the Ripuarian law. The use of the term
‘medius Alamannus’ seems to imply that there should
be a primus Alamannus as in the ‘Pactus.’ But what
these two classes of Alamanni with higher wergelds
than that of the liber were does not appear.</p>

<p>This later statement of the wergelds seems also
to contain a provision which can, I think, only be
explained by tribal custom. It occurs again in
clause XLVI., which enacts that the same payment
has to be paid to the parentes of a person sold out
of the country beyond recall as if he had been killed.
This rule is the same in the Salic and Ripuarian codes.
But in this law a distinction is made between the
case of a slain man leaving an heir, and the case of
his leaving no heir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld of
200 solidi
if no heir
of the
person
slain.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If he cannot recall him let him pay for him with a wergeld to
the parentes. That is twice 80 solidi if he leave an heir. But
if he does not leave an heir let him compound with 200 solidi.</p>

</div>

<p>The explanation must be that if the lost kinsman
leaves no heir, the loss is all the greater to the
kindred. This looks like a survival of tribal custom.
The dread of a family dying out lay, as we have seen,
at the root of the widespread custom which brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in the sister’s son to fill the vacant place when there
was no one else to keep up the family. This addition
in the later statement, though omitted in the ‘Pactus,’
pointing back as it appears to earlier custom, seems
to show that the Lex as well as the ‘Pactus’ may
in the matter of wergeld be traced to Alamannic
rather than Frankish sources.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld
of women.</div>

<p>In both the ‘Pactus’ and the Lex, as we have
seen, the wergelds of women were double those of
men. The Bavarian law gives the reason of the rule
(IV. 29) and also the reason why sometimes an
exception was made to the rule.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whilst a woman is unable to defend herself by arms, let her
receive a double composition; if, however, in the boldness of her
heart, like a man, she chooses to fight, her composition shall not
be double.</p>

</div>

<p>In titles XXIX. and XXX. of the Alamannic law
it is enacted that if a man be slain in the <i>curtis</i> of the
Dux a threefold wergeld must be paid, and that if the
messenger of the Dux be killed within the province
his triple wergeld must be paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
freeman’s
wergeld of
160 solidi
under
Bavarian
law.</div>

<p>In the Bavarian law the wergeld of the freeman
is stated to be 160 solidi, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If any one kill a free man (‘liberum hominem’) let there be paid
to his parentes, if he have any, or if he have no parentes to the
Dux or to him to whom he was commended whilst he lived, twice
80 solidi: that is, 160 solidi. (Tit. IV. c. 28.)</p>

</div>

<p>There are no wergelds mentioned in the Bavarian
law corresponding to those of the <i>medius Alamannus</i>
and the <i>primus Alamannus</i> of the Alamannic laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Higher
wergelds
of certain
families.</div>

<p>According to Tit. III. 1, there were certain
families who were held in double honour, and had
double wergelds. The Agilolvinga had fourfold
wergelds, being the family from whom the Dux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was chosen. The Dux himself had a fourfold wergeld
with one third added. If the life of any of his
parentes were taken the wergeld was, according to one
manuscript, 640, and according to another 600 solidi.</p>

<p>These wergelds of the Alamannic and Bavarian
laws are not on all fours with those of the Salic
and Ripuarian Laws. But in both cases the ordinary
freeman’s wergeld is 160 solidi (unless there be no
heir to inherit), so that in both cases the wergelds
correspond sufficiently with the clause in the Ripuarian
Laws which accords to them a wergeld of 160
solidi, after having before stated that strangers are
to be judged according to the laws under which they
were born.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds
of the
freedman
and the
servus.</div>

<p>In the Bavarian law there is special mention of
the freedman and the servus, and it is worth while to
dwell a moment on the position assigned to them as
compared with the ordinary freeman.</p>

<p>There are three titles headed as under:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="The titles">
  <tr>
    <td>Title</td>
    <td class="tdr">IV.</td>
    <td>De <i>liberis</i>, quo modo componuntur.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td class="tdr">V.</td>
    <td>De liberis qui per manum dimissi sunt liberi, quod <i>frilaz</i> vocant.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td class="tdr">VI.</td>
    <td>De <i>servis</i>, quo modo componuntur.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These clauses relate to injuries as well as to homicide.
As regards all minor injuries, the freedman is
paid for at one half, and the servus at one third, of
the payment to the liber for the same injury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Payments
for eye,
hand, or
foot one
fourth the
wergeld.</div>

<p>But when the payment comes to be for the eye,
hand, or foot, the difference is, roughly speaking,
doubled. The payment for the liber is 40 solidi,
for the freedman 10 solidi, and for the servus 6 solidi
(? 5 sol.). And these payments are seemingly intended
to be one quarter of the respective wergelds for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
homicide. We have seen that the wergeld of the
freeman was 160 solidi. These clauses state that the
freedman’s wergeld was 40 solidi, and that of the
servus 20 solidi, and that in both these cases the
lord took the payment.</p>

<p>In Tit. IV. 30, <i>De peregrinis transeuntibus viam</i>, the
passing stranger’s death was to be paid for with 100
solidi to his parentes, or in their absence to the fisc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bavarian
wergelds.</div>

<p>The wergelds of the Bavarian laws may therefore
be thus stated:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Ducal family (4 fold)</td>
    <td class="tdr">640</td>
    <td>solidi</td>

    <td>Families next in honour</td>

    <td>Servus</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>

<p>And all these solidi were gold solidi of Imperial
or Merovingian standard, it does not matter much
which.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No
wergeld
within the
family.</div>

<p>The crime of homicide within the near family was
dealt with in the Alamannic law in conformity with
ancient tribal custom. There was no wergeld in such
a case.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If any man wilfully kills his father, uncle, brother, or maternal
uncle (avunculus), or his brother’s son, or the son of his uncle or
maternal uncle, or his mother, or his sister, let him know that he
has acted against God, and not fulfilled brotherhood according
to the command of God, and heavily sinned against God. And
before all his parentes, let his goods be confiscated, and let
nothing of his pertain any more to his heirs. Moreover, let
him do penance according to the Canons. (Tit. XL.)</p>

</div>

<p>Once more in these laws the parricide (the fisc
having taken his property) goes free, but for the
penance required by the Canons of the Church.</p>

should have them; and he and his wife and children

<p>The lower clergy and monks were to be paid for
according to their birth <i>double</i>; parochial priests
threefold. (I. c. viii. and ix.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">The wife’s
inheritance
goes back
to her
kindred if
no
children

<p>In the <i>Liber secundus</i> of the Alamannic law is
an interesting clause which throws some light upon
the position of married women.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(XCV.) If any woman who has a paternal inheritance of her own,
after marriage and pregnancy, is delivered of a boy, and she herself
dies in childbirth, and the child remains alive long enough,
<i>i.e.</i> for an hour, or so that it can open its eyes and see the roof and
four walls of the house, and afterwards dies, its maternal inheritance
then belongs to its father.</p>

</div>

<p>This is natural, but it seems to show that if the
child had been born dead and the wife had died
without children her paternal inheritance would have
gone back to her kindred and not to her husband.</p>

<p>In the absence of other evidence this is perhaps
enough to show that in accordance with tribal custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the kindred of the wife had not lost all hold upon
their kinswoman, and therefore that she by her
marriage had not passed altogether out of her own
kindred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Traditional
value of
cattle
stated in
gold
tremisses.</div>

<p>Lastly, there are clauses in the same <i>Liber secundus</i>
which declare the value of the solidus in equation with
cattle.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>LXXX. Summus bovus 5 tremisses valet. Medianus 4 tremisses
valet. Minor quod appreciatus fuerit.</p>

<p>LXXVII. Illa mellissima vacca 4 tremisses liceat adpreciare.
Illa alia sequenteriana solidum 1.</p>

</div>

<p>These clauses show that the solidi in which the
wergelds were paid were gold solidi of three tremisses.</p>

<p>In the Ripuarian laws the ox was equated with
2 gold solidi, <i>i.e.</i> 6 tremisses, so that we learned from
the equation that the wergeld of the Ripuarian liber,
200 solidi, was really a wergeld of 100 oxen. But the
above equations show that under Alamannic law the
wergeld of the liber was not so.</p>

<p>In the Alamannic laws the best ox was valued only
at five tremisses instead of six, so that the wergeld
of 200 solidi of the medius Alamannus was really a
wergeld of 120 oxen; and the 160 solidi of the wergeld
of the <i>baro de mino flidis</i> of the ‘Pactus,’ or simple
‘liber’ of the Lex Hlotharii, was a wergeld of 96
oxen or 120 Alamannic ‘<i>sweetest cows</i>.’</p>

<p>Any one who has seen the magnificent fawn-coloured
oxen by which waggons are still drawn in
the streets of St. Gall will appreciate what the
‘summus bovus’ of the Alamannic region may have
been. Why it should have been worth in gold less
than the oxen of other lands does not appear.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>TRIBAL CUSTOMS OF THE TRIBES CONQUERED BY
CHARLEMAGNE.</i></span></h2>

<h3>I. THE EFFECT UPON WERGELDS OF THE NOVA MONETA.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>nova
moneta</i> of
Charlemagne.</div>

<p>We have reached a point in our inquiry at which it
becomes necessary to trouble the reader with further
details concerning the changes in the Frankish
currency, made by Charlemagne.</p>

<p>We are about to examine the customs as regards
wergelds of those tribes which owed their laws, in
the shape in which we have them, to the conquests of
Charlemagne. The alterations in the currency, made
literally whilst the laws were in course of construction,
naturally left marks of confusion in the texts
relating to wergelds, and we have to thread our way
through them as best we can.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A change
from gold
to silver.</div>

<p>The change which we have to try to understand
was in the first place a change from a gold to a
silver currency&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> from the gold currency of
Merovingian solidi and tremisses to the silver currency
of Charlemagne’s <i>nova moneta</i>.</p>

<p>There had been a certain amount of silver coinage
in circulation before, but the mass of the coinage had
been hitherto gold, mostly in gold tremisses.</p>

<p>In all the Frankish laws hitherto examined the
monetary unit was the gold solidus with its third&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
tremissis. And the only question was whether
the solidi and tremisses were of Imperial or of Merovingian
standard&mdash;whether the solidus was the
Merovingian solidus of 86·4 wheat-grains and the
tremissis 28·8, or the Imperial solidus of 96 wheat-grains
and the tremissis 32.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merovingian
kings first
used and
then
imitated
Imperial
coin.</div>

<p>As regards the Lex Salica, originally the solidus
was probably of the Imperial standard, because the
Merovingian kings at first in their coinage copied the
Imperial coins both in type and weight. And before
they issued a coinage of their own they made use of
Imperial coins, both gold and silver. Numismatists
point in illustration of this to the fact that in the
tomb of Childeric at Tournay were found no Frankish
coins, but a large number of Roman coins, gold and
silver, of dates from <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 408 to those of the contemporary
Emperor Leo I. (457-474). And for proof
that these Roman coins were afterwards imitated by
Merovingian princes M. Maurice Prou had only to
refer the student ‘to every page’ of his catalogue of
‘Les Monnaies Mérovingiennes.’<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
denarius
of the
Salic law
first the
scripulum
and then
the Merovingian
silver
tremissis
of
28·8 w.g.</div>

<p>Now, if the gold solidus was at first of 96 wheat-grains,
then the denarius (one fortieth) would be
2·4 wheat-grains of gold, and at a ratio of 1:10 the
denarius would be the scripulum of 24 wheat-grains
of silver, which was called by early metrologists the
‘denarius Gallicus.’ Further, at 1:12 the denarius
would become the Merovingian silver tremissis of 28·8.
So that probably the denarius of the Lex Salica may
originally have been the scripulum, and under later
Merovingian kings their own silver tremissis. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
these silver tremisses had probably been regarded as
the denarius of the Lex Salica for a century or two
at least before Charlemagne’s changes.</p>

<p>Up to this time, therefore, there was apparently
a distinct connection between the reckoning and
figures of the Lex Salica and the actual Frankish
coinage. The Merovingian coinage of gold and silver
tremisses of 28·8 wheat-grains was therefore, from
this point of view, so to speak, a tribal coinage for the
Franks themselves, but not one adapted for currency,
over a world-wide Empire such as Charlemagne
had in view, and with which at last, when adopting
the title of Emperor, he had practically to deal.</p>

<p>The changes he made in the currency were intimately
connected, not only in time but in policy,
with the extension of his kingdom and his ultimate
assumption of the Imperial title.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charlemagne,
on conquest
of
Italy,
raised the
gold and
silver
tremissis
to the
Imperial
standard
of 32 w.g.</div>

<p>His raising of the weight of the Frankish gold
tremissis and silver denarius from the Merovingian
standard of 28·8 to the Imperial standard of 32
wheat-grains was probably the result of his conquest
of Italy. He seems to have arranged it with the Pope,
for they issued silver denarii of the higher standard
with the impress of both their names upon them.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>It was natural that he should wish his coinage to
obtain currency throughout his dominions, and this
could not be expected if it was continued at a lower
standard than that of the Byzantine Emperor.</p>

<p>Not only in the currency, but also in other
matters, extended empire involved the breaking down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of tribal peculiarities and greater uniformity in legal
provisions and practice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lex
Salica
still in
force for
Franks.
And its
family
holdings
not yet
extinct.</div>

<p>To mention one instance suggested by our previous
inquiry, we have noticed how the extension of
Frankish rule in Gaul from the Loire to the Garonne
increased the difficulties of maintaining two laws as
to land. Strangers under Roman law, as in the ‘de
migrantibus,’ one by one were settling among Franks
holding alods or family holdings of terra Salica.
Extended conquests reversed the process, and in conquered
provinces immigrants living under Salic law
became strangers amongst vicini living under Roman,
Burgundian, or Wisigothic law.</p>

<p>The family holdings of terra Salica must have
now become the exception and not the rule. This
becomes evident in the provisions made for the army.</p>

<p>In the Capitulare of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 803,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> <i>de exercitu promovendo</i>,
it was ordered that every free man (‘liber
homo’) who, <i>de proprio suo</i> or as a benefice, had four
<i>mansi vestiti</i>, that is mansi occupied by tenants, should
equip himself and attend ‘in hostem.’ And those
not having so many mansi were to club together so
that for every four mansi a soldier should be found.
The possession of mansi had apparently become sufficiently
general to be taken as the typical form of
landholding.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 807<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> special arrangements were made for
the case of the recently conquered Frisians and
Saxons.</p>

<p>If help should be needed in Spain, every five of
the Saxons were to equip a sixth. If the need arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
nearer home, every two were to prepare a third.
Or if the need arose still closer at hand, all were to
come. Of the Frisians, counts and vassals and those
who held benefices, all were to come, and of those
who were poorer every six were to equip a seventh.
There is no mention of mansi in the case of the
Saxons and Frisians.</p>

<p>The Capitulare of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 803 seems to show that in
the longer settled districts of the Empire the possession
of so many mansi, <i>de proprio suo</i>, was the
prevalent form of landownership. So that, although
the lex Salica remained still in force, the number of
Franks living under it seems by this time to have
borne a very small proportion to those living under
Roman and other laws.</p>

<p>Family holdings under the Lex Salica were, however,
probably not quite extinct. In the ‘Capitula
generalia’ of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 825<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> was inserted the following
clause providing specially for family holdings, which
may possibly have been holdings of <i>terra Salica</i>,
though it is not so directly stated.</p>

<p>When we reflect that the Franks living under the
Lex Salica must have thus sunk into a small minority,
it becomes obvious that wider views must of necessity
have entered into the minds of Charlemagne and his
advisers, not only as regards land, but also as regards
the currency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
currency
of the Lex
Salica
only a
local one.</div>

<p>The currency of the Lex Salica, with its solidi of
40 denarii, was, as has been said, after all a local one.
And outside the old Frankish boundary, in the Wisigothic
region, as well as probably in Italy, the Roman
currency or local modifications of it apparently more
or less prevailed. Ecclesiastics, as we have seen,
even Alcuin himself, still used the terms of Roman
currency in writing on monetary matters to their
friends outside the Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Roman
drachma
or
<i>argenteus</i>
of 72 w.g.
the silver
denarius
of the
Empire.</div>

<p>To them the denarius was still the Roman
drachma of 72 wheat-grains of silver, commonly
called the <i>argenteus</i>, in contrast to the gold solidus or
<i>aureus</i>.</p>

<p>Gregory of Tours, when he has occasion to mention
monetary payments, speaks of <i>aurei</i>, <i>trientes</i>,
and <i>argentei</i>. In one story he speaks of <i>solidi</i>,
<i>trientes</i>, and <i>argentei</i>.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, in a supplement to the laws of the
Wisigoths<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> is a statement under the name of <i>Wamba
Rex</i> (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 672-680), which apparently represents the
monetary system in vogue south of the Frankish
boundary. It states that the pound of gold equalled 72
gold solidi, so that the gold solidus was not the Merovingian
solidus but that of Constantine. It then states
that the ‘dragma’ of gold = ‘<span class="smcapuc">XII</span> argentei.’ The
argenteus being the silver drachma, the ratio of gold
to silver was 1:12.</p>

<p>To Isidore of Seville, from his Spanish standpoint,
the silver drachma was still the denarius.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Dragma octava pars unciæ
est et <i>denarii</i> pondus argenti,

<p class="lang2of2">The drachma is the eighth part
of an ounce, and the weight of
the silver denarius containing
three scripula.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2"><i>Solidus</i> apud Latinos alio

<p class="lang2of2">The <i>solidus</i> with the Romans
is otherwise called the <i>sextula</i>
because it is one sixth of the
ounce; hence, as we have said,
the vulgar call the <i>solidus</i> the

is called the tremissis.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Thus the solidus was the typical gold unit or
aureus, and the drachma was the silver denarius or
argenteus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Twelve
drachmas
of silver =
at 1:10
the Merovingian
gold

<p>It is remarkable that at a ratio of 1:10 twelve
Wisigothic or Roman argentei or drachmas of silver
equalled exactly in wheat-grains the Merovingian
gold solidus current on the Frankish side of the
Garonne or the Loire.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem, then, probable that traditionally and
‘according to ancient custom’ outside the Frankish
kingdom the Merovingian gold solidus had been
equated with twelve silver argentei or denarii of this
reckoning, whilst within Frankish limits 40 of the
silver tremisses and now of the pence of the nova
moneta were reckoned as equal to the gold solidus
of the Lex Salica.</p>

<p>But even to the Frank the 40 denarii of the Lex
Salica may have become antiquated except for wergelds
and other payments under its provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The silver
solidus of
12 silver
tremisses
already in
use in
accounts,
as 1/20 of
the pound

<p>The practice apparently had already grown up
of reckoning 12 of the silver tremisses as a solidus
of silver, twenty of which went to the pound of 240
pence, without, however, any pretence being made
that this solidus of twelve silver pence was to be
reckoned as equal to the gold solidus in making
payments.</p>

<p>In the ‘Capitulare Liftinense’ of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 743<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> a payment
is enacted <i>de unaquaque cassata solidus, id est 12
denarii</i>. It was necessary to make this explanation.</p>

<p>It is not known how much earlier the practice of
reckoning in pounds of silver of 20 solidi of 12
denarii came into vogue, but it was long before the
issue of the nova moneta.</p>

<p>It might at first sight be thought that these
twelve denarii may have been twelve <i>argentei</i> or
drachmæ, but 240 drachmæ would make far more
than a pound. And by an edict of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 765<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Pippin
had enacted that out of a pound of silver not more
than 22 solidi were to be made, one of which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to go to the monetarius, and this clearly forbids
the supposition that the solidus could be of twelve
drachmæ. The pound would contain only eight such
solidi.</p>

<p>Another Capitulare of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 779<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> proves that the
twelve denarii were Merovingian denarii of 28·8
wheat-grains.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The issue of the new denarii of 32 wheat-grains
was apparently made before <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 781, for in that year
an edict was passed forbidding the currency of the
old denarii.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>There was nothing very remarkable in this raising
of the silver denarius from 28·8 to 32 wheat-grains.
It was merely adopting the Imperial standard.
But the extraordinary thing was that Charlemagne
seems to have thought that he could, by law,
substitute the solidus of 12 of his silver denarii for
the <i>gold solidus</i> hitherto in use. The gold currency
was going out and the silver currency was taking its
place; but it was quite another thing to make the
solidus of 12 silver denarii of 32 wheat-grains legal
tender in the place of the gold solidus of the Lex
Salica of 40 silver denarii of 28·8 wheat-grains. Yet
this was what Charlemagne did, though perhaps
only by degrees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charlemagne
enacted
that the
silver
solidus
should
be legal
tender for

<p>The change was made under the pretence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
sanction of ancient custom. In the addition made
to Tit. XXXVI. of the Ripuarian law the wording of
the clause as to the payment of wergelds was ‘Quod
si cum argento solvere contigerit, pro solido duodecim
denarios, <i>sicut antiquitus est constitutum</i>.’ And this
allusion to antiquity was repeated.</p>

<p>What was meant by this appeal to ancient custom
it is not easy to see, unless it might be the probably
long-established equation already mentioned between
12 Roman drachmas or argentei and the Merovingian
gold solidus. Very possibly this equation was older
than that of the 40 denarii to the solidus of the Lex
Salica.</p>

<p>In a series of remarkable articles contributed to
the <i>Forschungen zur Deutschen Geschichte</i> of 1862,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
Dr. Ad. Soetbeer endeavoured to show, and with considerable
force, that the introduction into the Lex
Salica of the round numbers of denarii&mdash;forty to the
solidus&mdash;was of comparatively late date; and if this
hypothesis be correct, then it may be that Charlemagne
was appealing to an earlier Frankish custom
of reckoning 12 silver denarii or drachmæ to the gold
solidus. But even if it could be so, obviously the
denarii of 12 to the solidus of ancient custom cannot
have been the same denarii as those which afterwards
were reckoned at 40 to the solidus.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">This
involved a
ratio of
1:4.</div>

<p>Economically speaking, the substitution of the
solidus of 12 denarii for the gold solidus, if they had
been Roman drachmæ, would have been reasonable
and might have made no change in prices; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
substitution of 12 of the new denarii of 32 wheat-grains
for the forty denarii of 28·8 wheat-grains,
involving a ratio between gold and silver of 1:4,
could only be justified by such a scarcity of silver as
would prevent a rise in prices. That it was not so
justified became very soon apparent.</p>

<p>Following the order of date, the Capitulare of
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 785, ‘de partibus Saxoniæ,’ shows that prices
when quoted in the solidus of 12 pence immediately
rose. The ox, the traditional value of which was
two gold solidi, is reckoned as worth ten silver
solidi. And M. Guérard has shown from the various
instances given in the ‘Polyptique d’Irminon’ that
on the estates of the Abbey of St. Germain-des-Prés
the price of oxen remained at an average of eight
silver solidi long after the death of Charlemagne.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The Lex Salica continued in force with all its fines
and wergelds stated in gold solidi of 40 denarii. And
a Capitulare of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 801<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> contains the following

<p>In <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 803 a clause was inserted in a Capitulare
to the effect that all debts to the King should be paid
in solidi of 12 denarii ‘excepta freda quæ in lege
Saliga scripta sunt.’<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> This looks like a general reservation
of the fines and wergelds of the Lex Salica.
But it does not seem to have been so intended, or
perhaps there was vacillation in the Councils of
the Emperor.</p>

<p>A Capitulare of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 816<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> contained the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">De omnibus debitis solvendis
<i>sicut antiquitus fuit constitutum</i>
per duodecim denarios solidus
solvatur per totam Salicam legem,
excepto leudis, si Saxo aut Friso

<p class="lang2of2">In the payment of all debts
<i>according to ancient custom</i> the
solidi shall be paid by 12 denarii
throughout Salic Law, except in
the case of wergelds, if a Saxon

let the solidus be paid by 40
denarii. Among Salic Franks, however,
on both sides as to all debts, as
we have said, 12 denarii shall be
paid for the solidus, whether in
the case of homicides or anything
else.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>As between Salic Franks, therefore, the solidus of
12 denarii was to be legal tender in payment of
wergelds and everything else.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>nova
moneta</i>
enforced
by
penalties.</div>

<p>This was all very well for debtors, but it was
not so satisfactory to creditors. The exception that,
when a Frank was killed by a Saxon or a Frisian,
the wergeld was still to be paid in the solidus of
40 denarii, was an admission that to receive it in
solidi of 12 denarii would have been a hardship. And
as to the general public, the acceptance of payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of debts in the denarii of the nova moneta had to be
secured by penalties. A clause was introduced into
the Capitulare of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 794<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> according to which
freemen refusing the new denarii were to be fined 15
solidi; whilst servi refusing them were to be publicly
beaten naked at a post.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And it
became
permanent
and
was
adopted
by Offa
and
Alfred.</div>

<p>The permanent result was very remarkable. The
new currency was maintained as legal tender in
France, and the gold currency practically disappeared.
Charlemagne and his successors coined very few
more gold solidi and tremisses. King Offa and after
him Alfred raised the English sceat to the penny of
32 wheat-grains, probably in imitation of the nova
moneta, and Charlemagne’s pound of 240 of these
pence&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of 7680 wheat-grains of silver&mdash;became
generally recognised as the pound of monetary
reckoning in Western Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But the
ratio
between
gold and
silver
went back
to 1:12.</div>

<p>So far Charlemagne triumphed. But in the
meantime the artificial ratio of 1:4, sought to be
established between gold and silver, could not be
maintained. The pound of silver remained the
standard in accounts, but one of Charlemagne’s
successors restored the Imperial ratio of 1:12 and
enacted that the pound of pure gold should no longer
be sold at any other price than 12 pounds of silver.
The date of the edict by which this restoration of
the old ratio was secured was <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 864.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>These were the changes in the currency which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
took place during the period of the formation of the
Lex Frisionum and Lex Saxonum which we have
next to examine.</p>

<p>No wonder that they should have introduced
confusion and alterations in the text of the various
clauses. And in order that we may be able to feel
our way through them it now only remains that we
should realise the actual difference between the
amount of silver in the 40 denarii of the solidus of
the Lex Salica and the amount of silver in the 12
denarii of the new solidus of the <i>nova moneta</i> which
had thenceforth to take its place as legal tender in
the payment of debts and wergelds.</p>

<p>In the first place, we know that the denarius of
the nova moneta was a silver penny of 32 wheat-grains,
so that Charlemagne’s solidus of 12 silver
pence contained 384 wheat-grains of silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All debts
could be
paid in
one third
of the
weight of
silver
required
before.</div>

<p>In the next place, whatever the denarii of the
Lex Salica may originally have been, we know that
the Merovingian silver denarii which had long been
current in France and in England were of the same
weight as the Merovingian gold tremisses, viz. 28·8
wheat-grains. Forty of these would contain 1152
wheat-grains of silver&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> exactly three times as
much silver as the twelve denarii of the nova moneta.</p>

<p>So that if a wergeld were paid in silver it could
now be paid in exactly one third of the weight of
silver hitherto required under the Salic law, and so
of every other debt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, not only was the ratio between gold and
silver disturbed, but also the ratio between money
and cattle. And this was an important matter in
the payment of wergelds, for, as we have seen, the
normal wergeld was 100 head of cattle. Obviously,
wergelds would no longer be paid, as of old, either
in gold or in cattle, when they could be paid at a
third of the value in silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In which
currency
are the
wergelds
of the
Frisians
and
Saxons
recorded
in the
laws?</div>

<p>In framing new laws representing the old customs
of the newly conquered Frisians and Saxons, the
question would certainly arise whether the wergelds
were to be stated in the equivalent of their old
customary value in cattle, or reduced to one third of
their old value by retaining the traditional number
of solidi as if they were still of the gold value.</p>

<p>We have seen that Frisians and Saxons were
exceptionally dealt with; but they had now become a
part of the Empire, and, with the best intentions,
how was the framer of their laws to describe their
ancient wergelds which had hitherto been paid in gold
solidi or in cattle? No one of the courses open to
him would be without its difficulties.</p>

<p>He might record the customary wergeld as still
to be paid in gold solidi; in which case the wergeld
would be three times that of neighbouring tribes who
could now pay their wergelds in silver.</p>

<p>Or he might divide the amount of the ancient
wergeld by three, so as to reduce it to the lower
level; in which case the number of animals in which
by long custom the wergeld had been paid would
be worth three times the wergeld payable in gold.</p>

<p>These would be the alternatives if the payment
in gold were continued, and never as yet in any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the laws had the wergelds been stated otherwise than
in gold.</p>

<p>There was only one other way open to the
legislator, if he wished to keep up the old customary
values, viz. to translate the gold values at the old
ratio into the new silver solidi: that is, to treble the
gold figures of the ancient customary wergelds and
make them payable in silver solidi. This would probably
be the best course if he wished to continue the
old relation of the wergelds to the animals in which
they had hitherto been mostly paid. But then it
might be difficult to enforce the payment of wergelds
in silver in districts where the currency was still
gold.</p>

<p>The legislator would, in any case, have to make up
his mind whether to lower the ancient wergelds of the
newly conquered tribes to a third of what they had
been, or to keep up the value of the wergelds and the
number of cattle in which they had from time immemorial
been paid.</p>

<p>The wergeld in the popular tribal mind was a
thing so fixed and so sacred that the makers of the Lex
Frisionum and the Lex Saxonum were almost certain
to find themselves between the horns of a dilemma.</p>

<h3>II. THE LEX FRISIONUM.</h3>

<p>The tribes conquered by Charlemagne, whose
laws we have now to examine, differed from those
whose laws and wergelds have been already considered
in one important particular. They were not conquering
tribes which had migrated into districts
already under Roman law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The conquests of Charlemagne over the Frisians
and Saxons were conquests of German tribes settled
as of old in their own countries. They were, moreover,
conquests of still pagan tribes by Christian and
partly Romanised Franks.</p>

<p>Frankish conquest had extended far into Frisian
and Westphalian territory under the Merovingian
kings. In Frisia Frankish influence was shown by
the existence of Merovingian mints at Duurstede.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
In Westphalia, at Soest and Paderborn, there were
already Christian churches under the jurisdiction of
the Archbishop of Cologne. But neither the conquest
nor the conversion was completed till the time of
Charlemagne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was the
wergeld
160 solidi?</div>

<p>We have already learned from Titles XXXI. and
XXXVI. of the Ripuarian law that there were Frisians
as well as Saxons, Burgundians, Alamanni, and
Bavarians resident in the Ripuarian district. Moreover,
it was directly stated that these immigrants were
to be judged, not by Ripuarian law, but by their
own law and custom. Further, being often isolated
and without kindred near them to swear for them, if
charged with crime they were to clear themselves by
the ordeal of fire or lot. And finally their wergeld
was stated to be 160 solidi, the inference being that
this was the wergeld of the Frisian freeman in his
own country, by the law and custom of which he was
to be judged.</p>

<p>So that we approach the text of the Frisian law
with this valuable earlier knowledge in our possession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Two centuries before the date to which the collection
of Frisian laws is assigned, the Ripuarian law bears
witness that the Frisian wergeld was 160 solidi.
Even if these clauses were not a part of the original
text and did not date back to the sixth century,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the
inference would be strong, and perhaps all the
stronger, that such must have been the wergeld at the
later date of the Frisian law. This earlier evidence
is important, as, without the clue it gives us and with
nothing but the Frisian law to guide us, we might
very easily have been led to a wrong conclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The laws
are of
different
dates.</div>

<p>There seems to be no text of the Frisian laws
earlier than that published by Herold at Basle in 1557,
and he does not state from whence he obtained the
text followed by him.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it is clear from internal evidence that
the laws as we have them are by no means of one
single date. They form, in fact, a collection of the
customs of the three districts into which Frisia was
divided, with modifications and various additions
made to the original collection at different times.</p>

<p>At first sight there are inconsistencies in the
statements of the wergelds, and, as in other cases, the
key to an understanding of them is to be found, to
some extent, in close attention to the currencies in
which the amounts of the compositions are stated.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enter into any discussion
of the various theories suggested to meet the difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
caused by the confusion of the various
currencies. The knowledge already obtained in the
course of this inquiry will, I think, if adhered to,
suffice to clear the way sufficiently for our purpose.
Bearing in mind that the ‘Lex Frisionum’ as
we have it is a compilation with various additions,
the inconsistencies in the text will be no surprise
provided that the reason for their occurrence is
apparent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The three
districts of
Frisia
and their
local
solidi.</div>

<p>Frisia was divided into three divisions, and in
certain glosses which appear late in the laws<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> we are
told that each division had a separate solidus of its
own.</p>

<p>(1) Between the <i>Laubach</i> and <i>Weser</i> (the Northern
division) the solidus is described as of two
denarii, <i>i.e.</i> tremisses, of the nova moneta.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> This
solidus, we shall find, was like that of the Saxon
tribes on the Eastern side of the Weser. The solidus,
being of two tremisses, contained sixty-four wheat-grains
of gold.</p>

<p>(2) In the middle division, between the <i>Laubach</i>
and <i>Fli</i>, the solidus is said to have been of three
denarii, or tremisses, of the nova moneta,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> <i>i.e.</i> ninety-six
wheat-grains of gold. This solidus is the gold
solidus of three tremisses after it had been raised by
Charlemagne to the standard of the Eastern Empire.</p>

<p>(3) In the Southern or Western divisions, between
the <i>Fli</i> and the <i>Sincfal</i>, the solidus was 2½ denarii<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
or tremisses <i>ad novam monetam</i>, <i>i.e.</i> eighty wheat-grains
of gold.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>But it seems to be clear that the statements of
the wergelds and other fines in earlier clauses of the
laws are not made in these local solidi.</p>

<p>Thus in Title XVI. we are told that <i>Inter Laubachi
et Sincfalam</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in both Middle and Southern divisions,
in cases of homicide the payment to the lord
for breach of his peace (<i>de freda</i>) was thirty solidi,
‘<i>which solidus consists of three denarii</i>,’ although the
local solidus of the Southern division was that of 2½
tremisses. Sometimes the fines are stated in solidi of
three tremisses and sometimes in solidi of 20 to the
pound. There is no difficulty, after what we have seen
in other laws, in recognising in the solidus of three
tremisses the <i>gold solidus</i>, and in the solidus of 20
to the pound the <i>silver solidus</i> of the Frankish
Empire.</p>

<p>Again, we at once recognise in the term <i>nova
moneta</i> the new standard of Charlemagne, and in
the term <i>veteres denarii</i>, which also occurs in the
laws, the gold or silver tremisses of the Merovingian
currency before the monetary reform of
Charlemagne.</p>

<p>All this is exactly what might be expected in laws
of somewhat different dates, some of them perhaps
going back to the time of the Merovingian conquests,
and others following upon the conquests of Charlemagne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds

<p>Having thus so far cleared the way, we pass

<p>These wergelds, with one exception, are alike
throughout, so far as regards the proportions between
the three classes. The wergeld of the liber is double
that of the litus, and that of the nobilis double
that of the liber except in the Middle district, in
which the wergeld of the nobilis is only 1½ times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that of the liber. In the same district there is an
additional payment to the <i>propinqui</i> of the litus,
his proper wergeld, half of that of the liber, going to
his lord.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the last district only
are the denarii (<i>i.e.</i> tremisses) stated to be <i>novæ
monetæ</i>. The inference is that in the other two
districts the tremisses, and therefore the solidi, were
of the lower Merovingian standard.</p>

<p>The district in which the tremisses were novæ
monetæ was the Southern district, first conquered
and most thoroughly brought under Frankish influence.
The other two districts had apparently not
yet so completely come under it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, if we take the 106⅔ solidi of the
nobilis of the Northern district to be of Merovingian
standard, the result is (106½ × 86·4 wheat-grains)
9216 wheat-grains, or exactly 16 Roman ounces, <i>i.e.</i>
the mina called, as we have seen, the Attic mina,
which in Scandinavian usage was divided into two
gold marks.</p>

<p>The wergeld of the nobilis in the Middle district
between the Laubach and the Fli is stated to be
80 solidi instead of 106 solidi and two denarii. But
as the wergeld of the liber and litus are the same as
those of the Northern district, and therefore also
presumably expressed in Merovingian currency, the
wergeld of 80 solidi of the nobilis, to be consistent,
should also be of the same Merovingian standard.
And so it seems to have been, for 80 Merovingian
solidi (80 × 86·4 wheat-grains) make exactly the
Roman pound of 6912 wheat-grains or 12 Roman
ounces, <i>i.e.</i> 1½ gold marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>In the wergelds of both Northern districts,
therefore, an original reckoning in gold marks of the
Scandinavian system seems to have been afterwards
translated with exactness into an uneven amount
and fractions of solidi of the Merovingian standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds
in gold
marks
of the
Baltic
tribes.</div>

<p>We may therefore state the wergelds of the two
districts north of the Zuider Zee in marks of the
Scandinavian system thus:</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Nobilis</td>
    <td>2 or 1½</td>
    <td>gold marks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Liber</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td><span class="ditto1">”</span> mark.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Litus</td>
    <td>½</td>
    <td><span class="ditto1">”</span> mark.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>That these wergelds could be stated thus evenly
in gold marks of the Scandinavian system, whilst in
Frankish solidi they could be stated only in uneven
numbers and fractions, is an interesting fact. It
seems to show that the original wergelds went back
to a time when the trade intercourse of Northern
Frisia was connected mainly with Scandinavia, the
Baltic, and the Eastern trade route. In ‘Beowulf’ we
found that Frisia was on the horizon of the area
included within the vision of the poet, the interest of
whose story lay chiefly in the Baltic.</p>

160 solidi.</div>

<p>Now let us compare the wergeld of the liber in
these districts, viz. 53 solidi and 1 tremissis of Merovingian
currency, with what the statement in the
Ripuarian law would lead us to expect it to have been,
viz. 160 of the same solidi. It is exactly one third
of what it ought to be. And the inference from
what we have learned in the last section would be
that the maker of the laws had divided the wergeld
of ancient custom by three.</p>

<p>But for the moment we pass on to follow further
the text of the Frisian laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Slave to
be paid
for at his
value.</div>

<p>In s. 11 of Tit. I. it is enacted that if any one,
whether nobilis, liber or litus, or servus, shall slay
the servus of another, he shall compound for the servus
according to his value. And in s. 13 of the same
title it is stated that if a slave shall kill either a
nobilis or liber or litus, unknown to his lord, the lord
of the slave shall swear that he did not order it and
pay twice the value of the slave. But if the lord
cannot deny that he ordered it he must pay for the
homicide as if he had done it with his own hand.</p>

<p>In Title IV. it is again enacted that if any one shall
kill the slave of another he shall be compounded for
at the value put upon him by his lord. And the
same rule is made to apply to the case of a horse,
ox, sheep, goat, pig, and all domestic animals, except
the dog: they are all to be paid for at the owner’s
estimate of value, or the alleged slayer must clear
himself with as many oaths as the judge may require.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
the dog.</div>

<p>The <i>dog</i> is the only animal whose value is fixed
by the law. And its value at first sight was not the
same in the several divisions.</p>

<p>The difference between the value of the dog in the
Northern and the other divisions can hardly be other
than one of different currencies. Probably the values
for the Northern division may be silver values. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
may, however, be remarked in passing that the value
of a dog in any case is not lightly to be regarded as
excessive. Its high value in the Frisian laws, and
also in other laws, shows how dependent the tribes
surrounded by forests were upon its help. In the
Cymric Codes, as we have seen, the herdsman’s dog was
worth as much as an ox. In the Alamannic Laws
the shepherd dog which could kill a wolf was valued
at 3 gold solidi, or half as much again as the ‘best
ox,’<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and in the Lex Salica the <i>canis pastoricalis</i><a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
was valued at 3 solidi. It is not difficult, therefore,
to understand how in Frisia the dog which could
kill a wolf should be worth 3 gold solidi, and the
ordinary shepherd dog a gold solidus.</p>

<p>We now come to a set of clauses in which the
differences between the three districts again appear,
and in one of which, viz. again the district between
the Laubach and the Weser, we meet with values
stated in <i>silver solidi</i> of 20 to the pound, <i>i.e.</i> of twelve
pence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Methods
of compurgation
and
ordeal.</div>

<p>These clauses are interesting as illustrating Frisian
methods of compurgation, the ordeal of the lot and
of hot water, and trial by battle, all of which evidently
belong to ancient tribal custom.</p>

<p>Title XIV. relates to the slaying of a man in a
crowd, and describes the means taken to ascertain
whose deed it was. Each division had its own custom.
That of the <i>Middle district</i> is first described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The relative of the slain may summon seven men and charge
each of them with the crime, and each is then put upon his
oath with eleven co-swearers. Then they are to go to the church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and lots are to be cast upon the altar, or if the church be too far
off the lots are to be cast upon relics.</p>

<p>The lots are to be two pieces (tali) cut from a rod and called
<i>teni</i>, on one only of which is the sign of the cross, the other being
left blank. A clean cloth is to be spread over the altar or the
relics, and then the priest (or if none, an innocent boy) ought to
take one of the lots from the altar and pray God to show by some
evident sign whether those seven who have sworn have sworn
truly. If he takes up the lot marked with the cross, then those
who have sworn were innocent. But if he takes up the other,
then each one of the seven makes his own lot, from a rod, and
marks his own sign on it, and so that both he and those standing
by can recognise it. And the lots shall be wrapped up in clean
cloth and laid upon the altar or relics, and the priest, if he be
there, and if not the innocent boy, as above, shall take up each
of them one by one from the altar, and shall ask him who knows
it to be his own lot. And he whose lot happens to be last shall be
compelled to pay the composition for the homicide. The rest,
whose lots have already been taken up, are absolved.</p>

<p>But if, in the first trial of the two lots, he takes up the one
marked with the cross, the seven shall be innocent, as aforesaid,
and he (the accuser), if he wishes, shall summon others for the
same homicide, and whoever may be summoned ought to clear
himself by complete oath with 11 co-swearers. And this shall
be enough for the accuser, nor can he bring any one further
to the lot.</p>

</div>

<p>This law prevailed between the Laubach and the
Fli. But between the Fli and the Sincfal for a case
of this kind the following was the custom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He who seeks composition for a homicide shall swear on
saints’ relics that he will not summon in this matter other than
those who are suspected by him of the actual homicide: and
then he shall summon for the homicide one or two, or even three
or four, or however many there be who have wounded him who
was slain. But though there were twenty, or even thirty, yet not
more than seven are to be summoned, and each of those summoned
shall swear with eleven others, and shall, after the oath has been
tested by the judgment of God, show himself innocent by the (ordeal
of) boiling water. He who swears first shall go to the ordeal first,
and the rest in order. He who shall be found guilty in the
ordeal shall pay the composition for the homicide, and to the
king twice his own wergeld: the rest of his co-swearers shall be
treated as above concerning perjurers.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the Laubach and the Weser the following
was the custom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He who seeks composition for homicide shall summon one
man, declaring him to be the homicide of his kinsman, and
saying that he ought to pay the ‘leud’ of the slain man. And if
he, in reply, says that he is willing to purge himself on oath with
his co-swearers, let him who has summoned him as homicide
say that he wishes to summon him <i>in placito publico</i>, and let
him so do. Let him summon him <i>in placito</i> before judges, and
let him who is summoned, if he cannot deny, show another
defendant for the homicide of which he is accused. And this ought
to be done thus:</p>

<p>Let him produce the man he wishes, and let him swear “he
is guilty of the homicide for which I am summoned,” holding him
by the hem of his cloak. But if he wishes to deny this oath let
him swear and go forth to wager of battle against him. And
whichever of them in that battle is conquered (<i>et sibi concrediderit</i>)
shall pay the ‘leud’ of the slain. But if he be slain
his next heir shall pay the composition of the homicide. But in
this battle it is lawful for either to pay a champion for himself if
he can find one. If the hired champion is slain, let him who
hired him pay sixty <i>solidi</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i>three libræ</i>) to the king, and over
and above pay the ‘leud’ of the slain man.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds
stated in
silver.</div>

<p>The payment of <i>sixty solidi</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> <i>three libræ</i>&mdash;clearly
indicates that the solidus of this clause was
the Frankish silver solidus of 12<i>d.</i>, of which 20 made
the pound of silver. And this helps us to understand
that the compositions described in the immediately
succeeding and closely connected clause are also
silver values. (Tit. XV.)</p>

<p>This is the custom in the same region observed for the composition
of wergeld:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values in silver">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>There can, I think, be no doubt that the libræ of
this clause are silver pounds, and further, that as
they are stated to be pounds ‘per denarios veteres’
they must be pounds of Merovingian and not of
Carlovingian weight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These
silver
values
equal to
the gold
ones at
the Norse
ratio 1:8.</div>

<p>The pounds of this statement are therefore Roman
pounds, of 240 Merovingian pence. Let us compare
then the wergeld of the liber of 5½ such pounds of
silver with the wergeld of the liber as stated in Tit. I.,
which we saw was equivalent to one mark of gold.
Following the Scandinavian ratio of 1:8, the mark
of 8 ounces of gold would equal 64 ounces of silver&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
5⅛ pounds instead of 5½. The silver wergeld
of the nobilis would equal 10⅔ pounds instead of 11.
The reckoning is rough, but near enough to justify
the conclusion that what was aimed at was the
nearest even pound of silver, and that therefore the
wergeld of the one statement is the equivalent of the
wergeld of the other statement.</p>

<p>At the same time the fact of the reckoning being
throughout in Roman, <i>i.e.</i> Merovingian pounds, and
not in those of Charlemagne’s <i>nova moneta</i>, is instructive.
It shows that this clause belongs to the period
during which the silver currency was pushing its
way into Frisia. A reckoning in silver had become
necessary, although, as we happen to know, the
Frisians had a special liking for gold. They continued
to coin gold much longer than the Franks,
and some years later than the date of the laws. The
Frisians were in close contact with the mint at
Duurstede, which was in fact the commercial metropolis
of the North at the date of the laws. The mint
at Duurstede continued to coin gold coins till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
city was destroyed by the ravages of the Northmen
in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 837, and it was from these Duurstede Frisian
coins that the types were taken of the first Scandinavian
coinage.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In the meantime the close connection
between Frisia and the Scandinavian district is quite
sufficient to account for the Scandinavian ratio of
1:8 being the one used in the translation of the
gold wergeld of the district next to the Weser into
a silver equivalent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>Let us now at last translate the wergelds of the
three Frisian districts, as stated in Tit. I. in gold
solidi of three tremisses, back again into what they
must have been when reckoned in the local solidi.
If originally they were reckoned in these local solidi
the result should be in even numbers.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that the wergelds of
the two districts north of the Zuider Zee, when
translated back again into local solidi, turn out to
have been in even numbers of such solidi, as well as
in even gold marks of the Scandinavian district,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
whilst those of the Southern district, most under
Frankish influence, make even numbers of the local
solidus but not of the mark.</p>

<p>When these Frisian wergelds in local solidi are
regarded in connection with the fact that the wergelds
on the east or Saxon side of the Weser were,
as we shall find, also paid in a local solidus, and that
this Saxon local solidus, like the solidi of the North
Frisian district, was of two tremisses, and further that
it represented the value of the one-year-old bullock,
we are led to conjecture that the Frisian local solidi
also may have represented the animal in which the
wergelds were originally reckoned and paid. And
this may perhaps be confirmed by the fact that, down
to comparatively modern times, the East Frisian
silver currency consisted chiefly of the <i>gulden</i> and
its one-tenth the <i>schaap</i>. Possibly the <i>gulden</i> of
this silver currency may point back to a time when
the ‘gold piece’ was reckoned of the value of ten
sheep.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> But this is conjecture only. The dog, as
we have seen, was the only animal whose value was
fixed in the laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why only
one third
of 160
solidi?</div>

<p>The fact that the gold and the silver values of the
wergelds of titles I. and XV. of the lex seem to
correspond leads up once more to the difficult question
why the wergeld of the liber should be exactly one
third of what the Ripuarian law apparently declared
it to have been.</p>

<p>Richthofen, in his preface and notes to the Frisian
laws in the edition of Pertz, points out that in later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
additions to the laws there is a curious duplication
and triplication of figures which has to be accounted
for. The facts seem to be these:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Tit. XXII. <i>De Dolg</i>, relating to the Middle
district and forming part of the more ancient law,
the fines for wounding are first given for the <i>liber</i>,
and then an explanation is made in the Epilogue that
those for the <i>nobilis</i> were one third higher and those
for the <i>litus</i> one half less. The composition for the
eye is stated to be half the wergeld.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fines and
perhaps
wergelds
trebled
afterwards.</div>

<p>Then, under the heading <i>Additio Sapientium</i>,
Tit. II., the amount for the hand is stated to be
‘25 solidi et 5 denarii.’ And after the mention of
the amounts for the several fingers are the words, ‘<i>Hoc
totum in triplo componantur</i>.’ The payments for hand
and eye are generally alike, and three times 25 solidi
and 5 denarii = 80 solidi, <i>i.e.</i> half a wergeld of 160 solidi.</p>

<p>Immediately following these words Tit. III. begins
with the statement that the foot entirely cut off is to
be compounded for as the hand, <i>i.e.</i> by 53 solidi and
1 tremissis, being double the previous amount. The
payment for the eye put out is ‘ter quadraginta
solidi,’ <i>i.e.</i> 120 solidi. Then whilst in the title <i>De Dolg</i>
the ear is valued at 12 solidi, in Tit. III. of the
Additio it is valued at ‘<i>ter</i> duodecim solidi.’ Again,
according to the title <i>De Dolg</i>, if both testicles were
destroyed, the whole wergeld was to be paid: and in
Title III. of the Additio the fine has become <i>ter</i>
53 solidi and 1 tremissis, three times the wergeld of
the liber in Tit. I.</p>

<p>It is not needful to pursue the comparison further
than to point out that Richthofen had some reason at
any rate to form the opinion that in the additions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the law made, as he thinks, after <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 785 and
probably about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 802, the <i>wergelds</i> were trebled, as
well as some of the payments for wounds; and that
the inference from the Ripuarian laws that the Frisian
wergeld was 160 solidi was therefore correct.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>So far Richthofen’s contention is, I think, a correct
one.</p>

<p>But what was the reason of this trebling of the
wergeld in the additions to the laws?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
wergeld
of ‘liber’
was probably
160
solidi.</div>

<p>Was it that the ancient wergelds were originally
one third of those of neighbouring tribes and trebled at
some auspicious moment to make them correspond with
others; or have we not rather to do with the results of
that confusion in the currency which was caused by
the endeavour to force into use the silver solidus of
12 pence as the equivalent of the gold solidus?</p>

<p>This conjecture standing by itself on the evidence
of these laws alone would be too hazardous to build
upon, and it is not necessary to consider it further in
this place. The matter of chief importance is that,
all things considered, there seems to be fairly
sufficient evidence that the wergelds of Tit. I.
represent the ancient wergelds divided by three, and
that accordingly we may take the wergeld of the
liber in the two Northern districts of Frisia to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
been three gold marks or 160 Merovingian gold solidi,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
as stated in the Ripuarian laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Division
of wergeld
among
grades of
kindred.</div>

<p>With regard to the distribution or division of the
wergeld amongst the relations of the person slain,
the laws mention only the custom of the Middle
districts, according to which two thirds of the wergeld
went to the heir of the slain and one third ‘ad propinquos
proximos.’ They give no information as to
how the ‘propinqui proximi’ divided their third
amongst themselves, or to what grade of kinship this
class of relations extended.</p>

<p>Happily, however, Dr. Brunner, in his informing
essay on ‘Sippe und Wergeld’ already quoted, has
been able to supplement the meagre information
given by the laws as to wergelds with further details
gained from later local sources.</p>

<p>In his section (p. 25) on ‘Die Friesen zwischen
Zuidersee und Weser,’ he gives an illustration of the
way in which under later custom the payment of
the wergeld was divided amongst the relations of the
slain. He states that the North Frisian <i>tale</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the
third share which the kindred had to pay, was known
as the <i>mentele</i> or <i>meitele</i> (magzahl).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later
example.</div>

<p>In a legal document of ‘Westerlauwersches
Friesland’ the <i>mentele</i> of the kindred is described as
4 lbs. 5 oz. 6⅔<i>d.</i>, and the <i>erbsühne</i>, or two thirds to
be paid by the heirs, as 8 lbs. 10 oz. 13⅓ pfennig.
The pound, we are told, is 12 oz. of 20<i>d.</i>, so that here
we have clearly Frankish currency and <i>silver</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
third and the two thirds together make a whole wergeld
of 13 lbs. 4 oz. of silver. Now in the first place if,
as we probably should do, we were to consider this
wergeld to be stated in pounds and ounces of
Charlemagne’s nova moneta, it would be not very far
from treble the amount of the wergeld of the liber in
Titles I. and XV. of the laws. And this, so far as it
goes, confirms the Ripuarian statement that the
ancient Frisian wergeld was one of 160 solidi.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Let us now see how the third falling on the
kindred was divided.</p>

was divided thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>This interesting illustration of the payment of a
Frisian wergeld, though of later date than the laws,
confirms the statement in the laws that in its division
the immediate heirs of the slain took two thirds and
the <i>propinqui proximi</i> one third. It shows that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a later date the immediate ‘erbsühne’ was two-thirds,
and the share of the kindred one third. And
it adds the important point that the kindred who
paid, and by inference shared in the receipt of the
one third, were confined to the descendants of the
great-grandparents, both paternal and maternal, of
the slayer or of the slain.</p>

<h3>III. THE LEX SAXONUM.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Divisions
of the
Saxon
tribes.</div>

<p>In turning from the Frisian to the Saxon district,
we have again to notice that, as in the Frisian instance,
so in the Saxon, the territory over which the law had
force was divided into several districts belonging to
allied but separate tribes with their own peculiar
customs.</p>

<p>The Westfali and the Ostfali and the Angrarii
were the chief tribes with which the Lex Saxonum
and the Capitularies had to deal. The ‘Saxones
Bortrenses’ and ‘Septentrionales’ are also mentioned
in one of the Capitularies, but these do not appear to
be of much importance to our inquiry.</p>

<p>The stubborn resistance of the Saxon tribes to the
Frankish conquest, and the sanguinary character of
the Saxon wars of Charlemagne, may well have made
a cleaner sweep of local custom from these districts
than had taken place in others. And this may explain
to some extent the disappointing silence of the
Lex Saxonum upon questions of custom which might
otherwise have been expected to afford useful and
interesting points for comparison with the Kentish
and Anglo-Saxon Laws. Moreover, the wergelds as
stated in the text are, like those of the Frisian Laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
at first sight so misleading that only a very careful
regard to the changes in Frankish currency can make
their amounts intelligible, and bring them into line
with those of neighbouring tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Statement
of wergelds
of
<i>nobilis</i>
and <i>litus</i>.</div>

<p>Happily, in approaching the wergelds of the Lex
Saxonum, we can do so, as in the case of the Frisian
wergelds, with the statement of the Ripuarian Law in
mind, that the Saxon as well as the Frisian wergeld
was 160 solidi. And it is well that we can do so, for
otherwise we might very easily lose our way.</p>

<p>The Lex Saxonum begins with a title ‘de
vulneribus’ which describes the payments to be made
for the different wounds inflicted upon a <i>nobilis</i>.
Title II., ‘de homicidiis,’ next follows with a statement
of the wergelds.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Qui nobilem occiderit, 1440
solidos conponat; ruoda dicitur
apud Saxones 120 solidi et in premium
120 solidi.…</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Let him who shall kill a
<i>nobilis</i> make composition 1440
solidi; the Saxons call ‘ruoda’
120 solidi, and ‘in premium’ 120
solidi.…</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Litus occisus 120 solidis componatur.…</p>

<p class="lang2of2">The <i>litus</i> killed is compounded
for with 120 solidi.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Much controversy has arisen upon the two extra
payments ‘ruoda’ and ‘in premium;’ but whatever
they may have been, they need not surprise us.
Though we may not be able to identify them with
the ‘halsfang’ or the ‘wites’ and ‘bots’ of Anglo-Saxon
laws, they were probably payments of something
of the same kind, additional to the wergeld.</p>

<p>It is more important to remark the absence altogether
of any mention of the ordinary ‘liber’ or
‘ingenuus’ between the nobilis and the litus, especially
as in the title on theft the three classes are
all mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Clause 2 of the Tit. II. of the Lex,
married women had the same wergelds as men.
Those unmarried were to be paid for with a double
wergeld. And by Clause 4 a servus slain by a
nobilis was to be paid for with 36 solidi.</p>

<p>By Clause 5:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Litus si per jussum vel
consilium domini sui hominem
occiderit, ut puta nobilem,
dominus compositionem persolvat
vel faidam portet. Si autem
absque conscientia domini hoc
fecerit, dimittatur a domino, et
vindicetur in illo et aliis septem
consanguineis ejus a propinquis
occisi, et dominus liti se in hoc
conscium non esse cum undecim
juret.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If a litus shall slay a man,
<i>e.g.</i> a <i>nobilis</i>, by the order or
counsel of his lord, the lord shall
pay the composition or bear the
feud. But if the litus shall do this
without the knowledge of the
lord, he shall be dismissed by the
lord and avengement made on
himself and seven others of his
blood by the near kindred of the
slain, and the lord of the litus
shall swear with eleven [compurgators]
that he had no knowledge
of the deed.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
the ox
2 solidi.</div>

<p>Title IV. on Theft is interesting as, besides mentioning
the <i>liber</i>, it fixes the value of the four-year-old ox at
the date of the clause at 2 solidi, <i>i.e.</i> the old ox-unit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>VI. He who by <i>night</i> steals a four-year-old ox, which is
worth 2 solidi, shall be punished by his head.</p>

</div>

<p>Theft of bees from within another’s fence or of
things to the value of two solidi by night from a
house, or of things of any kind, day or night, of the
value of <i>three</i> solidi, was to be capitally punished.
Theft of things of less value than three solidi was
to be compounded for ninefold, and <i>pro freda</i> the
nobilis was to pay 12, the liber 6, and the litus 4 (? 3)
solidi.</p>

<p>In Clause 6 of Title II. is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si mordum totum quis fecerit,
componatur primo in simplo
juxta conditionem suam; cujus
multæ pars tertia a proximis ejus
qui facinus perpetravit componenda
est, duæ vero partes
ab illo; et insuper octies ab eo
componatur, et ille ac filii ejus
soli sint faidosi.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If any one commit murder
with aggravation of concealment
he (the murderer) makes
composition first <i>in simplo</i> according
to his condition, of which
payment one-third part is to be
paid by the next of kin of him
who has perpetrated the crime,
and two-thirds by himself; and
besides eight times (the wergeld)
is to be paid by him, and he and
his children alone shall be in
feud.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Murderer
pays two
thirds and
his
kindred
one third
of wergeld,
as in
Frisian
law.</div>

<p>This clause is valuable as showing that, as in the
customs of Frisia and most other Low German tribes,
the murderer paid two thirds and his kinsmen one
third of the wergeld in ordinary cases.</p>

<p>The murderer and his children alone had to pay
the eight parts added for the aggravation of the
crime by concealment.</p>

<p>That the Lex Saxonum is in some things at least
a record of local custom is shown by the fact that, as
in Frisia, varieties were recognised in the several
divisions of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Local
customs
as to
dower
of wife.</div>

<p>The payment for taking a wife, in all the divisions,
was 300 solidi (Tit. VI.), to be paid to her parentes if
with their consent. If with <i>her</i> consent, but not with
theirs, the payment was doubled. If she were seized
without the consent of either, she must be restored
to her ‘parentes’ with 300 solidi to them and 240 to
her. Tit. VIII., however, shows that with regard to
dower the customs of the several districts varied.
Among the Ostfali and the Angrarii, if a wife bore
children, she, the mother, retained the dower received
on marriage for her life and left it to her
children. Should she survive her children <i>her</i> next
heirs received it. If there were no children, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
rule was <i>dos ad dantem</i>, <i>i.e.</i> it went to the husband,
or, if he were not alive, to <i>his</i> heirs. Amongst the
Westfali, after a woman had borne children she kept
the dower till her death. After her death, <i>dos ad
dantem</i>, it went to the husband or the husband’s
next heirs. Further, Tit. IX. states that as regards
what had been acquired by man and wife together,
amongst the Westfali the wife received half, but
amongst the Ostfali and Angrarii nothing: she had to
be content with her dower.</p>

<p>The final clause of the laws, which describes the
currency in which the payments were made, is important.

<p>And in the Codex Lindenbrogius:<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Westfalaiorum et Angrariorum

ox two solidi; two oxen, with
which one can plough, five solidi;
good ox, three solidi; cow with
calf, two-and-a-half solidi.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>According to the original final clause, if it had
been followed in the text of the Lex Saxonum the
wergelds ought to have been stated in gold solidi of
two tremisses, representing the bullock, or a sheep
with her lamb. And the lesser penalties for wounds,
&amp;c., should have been stated in solidi of three tremisses,
representing the ox of 16 months. These
values in gold tremisses would then have been consistent
with that of the full-grown four-year-old ox
as stated in Tit. VI. at two solidi&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the normal
value of the ox before the change in the currency.</p>

<p>But, as it is, the text is not consistent throughout.
Returning to the statement of the wergelds:</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Nobilis</td>
    <td class="tdr">1440</td>
    <td>solidi.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Litus</td>
    <td class="tdr">120</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">we are struck at once with the excessive amount of
that of the nobilis. But if the solidi were of two
tremisses, as they should have been, then, translated
into solidi of three tremisses, the amounts would
stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Nobilis</td>
    <td class="tdr">960</td>
    <td>solidi,</td>
    <td>or</td>

    <td>or</td>
    <td class="tdr">120</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These amounts appear to be still far too large;
whether regarded in cattle or in gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
statement
of wergelds
seems
to be in
silver
solidi.</div>

<p>It seems probable that, in spite of the last clause,
the wergelds of the Lex Saxonum, in the text as we
have it, are described in Charlemagne’s <i>silver solidi
of</i> 12<i>d.</i>&mdash;the solidi which at the moment he was
trying at a ratio of 1:4 to substitute for gold.</p>

<p>Very nearly contemporary with the Lex Saxonum
is Charlemagne’s <i>Capitulare de partibus Saxonie</i>, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
785.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In this document no wergelds are mentioned,
but other fines are described which may be compared
with them. And it will be noticed that three classes
are mentioned&mdash;nobilis, ingenuus, and litus.</p>

<p>In s. 19, for refusal to baptize an infant within a
year of birth:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Nobilis</td>
    <td class="tdr">120</td>
    <td>solidi to the fisc.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Ingenuus</td>
    <td class="tdr">60</td>
    <td><span class="ditto2">”</span> <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Litus</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>
    <td><span class="ditto2">”</span> <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So again in s. 20 for illicit marriage, and in s. 21
for engaging in pagan rites:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Nobilis</td>
    <td>60 solidi.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Litus</td>
    <td>15 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These fines were evidently payable in the silver
solidus, for in s. 27 the penalty for a man remaining
at home contrary to the bann was to be 10 <i>solidi</i> or
<i>one ox</i>. Obviously this is the value of the ox in
silver solidi before they were made legal tender. Its
gold value was only 2 solidi, as stated in Tit. VI.
of the Lex. And, as we have seen, the value of the ox
in the silver solidus of twelve pence was maintained
at an average of about 8 solidi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capitulare
of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
797.</div>

<p>Twelve years later in date another Capitulare
was issued, entitled <i>Capitulare Saxonicum</i> and dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 797.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> It was the result of a conference and contract
between Franks and Saxons of the three tribes,
Westfali, Angrarii, and Ostfali. According to s. 3
the Saxons agreed that whenever, under the laws,
Franks had to pay 15 solidi, the Saxon nobilis
should pay 12 solidi, ingenui 5 solidi, and liti 4
solidi.</p>

<p>Then follows a clause which is interesting as
showing that the payment of wergelds still was a
general practice. It enacted that when a homicide had
occurred and a case had been settled in a district by
the neighbours, the pacificators should, according to
custom, receive 12 solidi for their trouble (<i>pro districtione</i>),
and in respect of the wergeld (<i>pro wargida</i>)
they should have sanction to do what according to
their custom they had been used to do. But if the
cause had been settled in the presence of a <i>royal
Missus</i>, then it was conceded that on account of that
wergeld the neighbours should still have their
12 solidi; and that the Missus of the King, for the
trouble taken in the matter, should receive another
12 solidi, <i>ad partem Regis</i>. In clause 7, homicide of
a <i>Missus regalis</i>, or theft from him, was to be paid for
threefold.</p>

<p>Further, in Clause 9, the King, with the consent
of Franks and Saxons, was to have power at his
pleasure, whether <i>propter pacem</i>, or <i>propter faidam</i>,
or for greater causes, to double the amount of the
usual <i>bann</i> of 60 solidi, making it 120 solidi, and to
insure obedience to his commands by any amount
up to 100 or even 1000 solidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, in the final clause is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds
payable in
cattle &amp;c.
or in the
silver
solidi of
12 pence.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Moreover, it is to be noted what the solidi of the Saxons
ought to be, <i>i.e.</i>:</p>

<p>The one-year-old bullock of either sex in autumn, as it is sent
into the stable, for 1 solidus. Likewise in spring, when it leaves
the stable, and afterwards as it grows in age, so its price increases.
<i>De annona bortrinis</i> let them give for a solidus 40
<i>scapili</i>, and of rye 20.</p>

<p><i>Septentrionales</i> for a solidus, of oats 30 scapili, of rye 15.</p>

<p><i>Bortrensi</i> 1½ sicla of honey for a solidus. <i>Septentrionales</i>
2 sicla of honey for a solidus; also of clean barley they give the
same as of rye for a solidus.</p>

<p>In silver let them make twelve pence the solidus. (<i>In argento
duodecim denarios solidum faciant.</i>) In other things at the
price of estimation.</p>

</div>

<p>So that in this Capitulare of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 797, issued just
before Charlemagne became Emperor, there is the
clear statement that the one-year-old bullock is still
to be reckoned as one solidus, and the further statement
that in silver 12 pence make the solidus. And
this in a clause headed with the words: ‘Moreover
it is to be noted what the solidi of the Saxons ought
to be.’</p>

<p>The fact therefore seems to be that these
Capitularies relating to the Saxons, and the Lex
Saxonum, following upon the Conquest of the
Saxons, date from the middle of the time when the
change in the currency from gold to silver was
taking place, and the silver solidus of 12 pence, first
of Merovingian standard and ultimately of the <i>nova
moneta</i>, was by law made equivalent for payments
to the gold solidus of the Lex Salica of three gold
tremisses or of 40 pence.</p>

<p>Now, having derived this information from the
Capitularies, let us turn back to the laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Destruction
of
eye &amp;c.
paid for
with a
half wergeld.</div>

<p>In Tit. I. <i>De vulneribus</i>, the penalty for destroying
another’s eye is 720 solidi, exactly half the number
of solidi in the wergeld of the nobilis, and for both
eyes 1,440 solidi&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> exactly the amount of the whole
wergeld of the nobilis. These proportions are found
in several other laws, and were quite natural if the
payments were made in both cases in the <i>same</i> solidi.
But these wounds ought, according to the final
clause in the law, to have been paid for in the solidus
of three tremisses, while the wergelds should have
been paid in solidi of two tremisses.</p>

<p>Clearly they are <i>not</i> stated in different solidi, for
if for a moment we take them to be so, then the two
eyes of the nobilis would be paid for at a higher
value than his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The solidi
must be
silver
solidi.</div>

<p>Further, if we look at these payments for wounds
carefully, it becomes clear that they cannot be <i>gold</i>
values. Three hundred and sixty gold solidi for a
thumb and 260 for the little finger of a nobilis are
quite impossible fines. The little finger of the Saxon
nobilis cannot have been valued at more than the
ordinary freeman’s wergeld under the Salic and
Ripuarian Laws.</p>

<p>We conclude then that, in spite of the last clause
in the law, these values, both for wounds and homicide,
are silver values, and that the figures in the
text have at some date or other been substituted for
the original ones to meet the change in the currency.</p>

<p>Let us try to realise what the effect upon the
wergelds of the Lex Saxonum would be of Charlemagne’s
substitution of the silver solidus of 12<i>d.</i> for
the gold solidus.</p>

<p>Up to this time the wergelds had been paid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
bullocks valued in gold at the solidus of two tremisses,
and the equation was one no doubt of ancient
custom. Now the Capitularies made them payable
in silver at 12<i>d.</i> to the solidus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion
in the
currency.</div>

<p>One result became at once apparent. In the
Saxon district the value of the ox went up, as we
have seen, from two of the gold solidi to ten of the
new silver solidi&mdash;an excessive rise, no doubt, and
one likely to startle everybody. As regards most
debts the change did not matter very much. The
debtor got the advantage. But as regards wergelds
hitherto payable in cattle and in gold it mattered
very much indeed. It meant that a wergeld of 100
head of cattle could be paid in silver at one third
of their value. And Charlemagne’s advisers soon
found this out. What if a Frisian or a Saxon killed
a Frank? Was he to be allowed to escape with a
silver payment of one third the value of the cattle?
Certainly not; and so, as we have seen in the
Capitularies of 781 and 801 enforcing the receipt of
the silver solidus of 12<i>d.</i> for all debts, an exception
was made of wergelds payable by Saxons and Frisians
who killed a Salic Frank. These were still to be
paid for, as heretofore, in the solidus of 40<i>d.</i> of the
Lex Salica&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the gold solidus of three tremisses.</p>

<p>This, so far as the wergelds were concerned, set
the matter right when a Saxon killed a Frank; but
it did not set it right in the ordinary case of a Saxon
slaying a Saxon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The wergelds
must be
divided by
three to
obtain
value in
gold
solidi.</div>

<p>How could this be remedied but by altering the
figures of the wergeld and the compositions for
wounds, and inserting silver values instead of the
gold ones? This seems to have been clumsily done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the other clauses in the laws being apparently left
unaltered or only partially altered. But assuming
that the wergelds as they appear in the present text
of Tit. II. are stated in silver solidi of twelve denarii,
let us divide them by three, so as to restore them to
gold values in solidi of three tremisses.</p>

<p>The wergeld of the nobilis of 1440 solidi
divided by three becomes 480 solidi of three tremisses.
And if, following very common precedents, we take
this wergeld of the nobilis, whether from his noble
birth or natural official position, to be a triple wergeld,
then the missing wergeld of the <i>liber</i> or <i>ingenuus</i>
would be 160 solidi, as the passage in the Ripuarian
laws so often quoted declared it to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld
of ‘liber’
then 160

<p>The wergelds would then stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>These then are the figures which, if we are right,
were the original figures of the Title <i>De homicidiis</i>.</p>

<h3>IV. LEX ANGLIORUM ET WERINORUM, HOC EST

<p>We may probably follow Richthofen<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> in his conclusions
that the Thuringians of these laws were the
tribes settled with the Anglii and Werini in North
Thuringia, and that they were promulgated under
Charlemagne about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 802.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A half
wergeld
for destruction
of an eye,
hand, or
foot.</div>

<p>The rest of the first five titles relate to wounds,
and we need only mention that the destruction of an
eye, hand, or foot, or a blow causing loss of hearing,
was to be paid for with <i>half</i> the wergeld of each
class, following in this respect the custom of the
Frisian and Saxon tribes.</p>

<p>These five titles in the Corvey Manuscript of the
tenth century constitute a whole under the title ‘Lex
Thuringorum.’ The remaining titles are, in this
manuscript, added to the Lex Saxonum, to which,
however, they do not appear to belong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Triple
wergeld
of the
Adaling.</div>

<p>The triple wergeld of the Adaling of these laws
may have been the result either of noble birth or
official position, or both combined. The wergeld of
the <i>liber</i> of 200 gold solidi, presumably of three
tremisses, seems to connect the customs of the
Thuringian tribes of these laws with those of the
Salic and Ripuarian Franks rather than with those of
the Saxons and Frisians. It is worth notice, too, that,
while in the Lex Saxonum and the Lex Frisionum
the figures seem to follow a duodecimal system, in
these laws the more usual decimal reckoning is retained
as in the Lex Salica.</p>

<p>The fact that among the additional titles there is
one ‘De alodibus’ connects still further these laws,
notwithstanding their later date, with the Salic and
Ripuarian laws which contain similar titles. And it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
is worth while, for purposes of comparison, to give it

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The alod
included
both land
and cattle.</div>

<p>As in the other laws so under these rules the
alod clearly embraced both the land and the
‘pecunia’ and ‘mancipia’ upon it. Its object, like
that of the similar clauses in the other laws and also
like that of the Edict of Chilperic, seems to have been
to protect the land in ordinary cases from passing
over ‘from the spear to the spindle,’ while at the
same time sanctioning inheritance by females even
in the land of the alod when otherwise there would
be danger of its passing away from the kindred
altogether.</p>

<p>In certain cases the land of the alod was made to
go to male heirs while the ‘pecunia’ and ‘mancipia’
upon it went to females.</p>

<p>Whether the word ‘pecunia’ in such cases should
be translated by ‘cattle’<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> or the wider word ‘chattels,’
it must have included the cattle, and at first sight it is
not easy to see how the rule would work which
gave the cattle of the alod to a female and the land
to a distant male heir. The cattle must in the
nature of things have remained or be put upon land,
and the awkward question arises upon whose land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
they remained or were put. And so we are brought
once more to the practical question of the position of
women in relation to the land. That in certain
cases in default of male heirs they could inherit land
is one thing; but this question of the cattle and
slaves involves quite another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Male next
of kin
takes the
land and
chieftainship,
but
females
may have
cattle
upon the
land.</div>

<p>When a sister received her portion or gwaddol
under Cymric custom, and when she received so
many cows for her maintenance from the chief
of kindred, she must have had rights of grazing
for her cattle in the family herd of her gwely.
Till she married, her cattle would graze with
the cattle of her paternal gwely; and when she
married, with the cattle of her husband’s gwely.
And so under the rules of this clause ‘De alodibus’
it does not follow that the distant male heir
succeeding to the land of the alod was to evict
her and her cattle from it. With the land he had
to take also the responsibilities involved in the
family holding. Clause V. states that to whomsoever
the inheritance of the land shall come,
to him ought to pertain the coat of mail, <i>i.e.</i> the
birnie, and with it the duty of the chief of the
kindred to avenge his kin and to see to the payment
of wergeld if any one of the kin should be slain.
Read from this point of view this clause ‘De alodibus’
becomes good evidence that, whatever changes may
have been made as to female inheritance, the <i>land</i> of
the alod had not yet lost all its tribal traits. It
had not yet become the ‘res propria’ of an individual
possessor under Roman law.</p>

<h3>V. THE SO-CALLED LEX CHAMAVORUM.</h3>

<p>This document, according to most recent authorities,
relates to a district between the Frisians and
Saxons to the North and East, with the river Meuse
to the South.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Chamavi
under
Frankish
law.</div>

<p>Its real title seems to be <i>Notitia vel commemoratio
de illa euva quæ se ad Amorem habet</i>, and it seems to
be not so much a code as a memorandum of the
wergelds and fines of a Frankish people settled in the
district alluded to. Probably in date it may belong
to the time of Charlemagne, but before his changes
in the currency.</p>

<p>It is of some interest to this inquiry because of
its peculiar position, as relating to a tribe or people
under Frankish rule, and yet with customs of its own
which have survived Frankish conquest.</p>

<p>The Notitia starts with the declaration that in
ecclesiastical matters, as regards the <i>bannus dominicus</i>,
the same laws prevail ‘as other Franks have.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld

</div>

<p>Then follows a clause (VII.) which states that if
any ‘Comes’ be slain in his own ‘comitatus’ the wergeld
is to be three times that according to his birth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Homo Francus</i> thus has a triple wergeld, like
the Comes. But the <i>Comes</i> may possibly be not
<i>ingenuus</i>. He may be a lidus with official position,
and so presumably, according to Clause VII., with a
threefold wergeld of only 300 solidi.</p>

<p>In the next clause the Royal ‘Missus’ is put in
the same position while on the King’s business. His
wergeld is also to be trebled.</p>

<p>What, then, is the <i>Homo Francus</i> with a wergeld
three times that of the ordinary <i>ingenuus</i> of the district
of Amor?</p>

<p>The wergeld of the latter is the full normal
wergeld of 200 solidi. The Homo Francus in this
district was therefore very much above the ordinary
freemen of other laws. He was evidently a
Frankish landowner on a large scale, towering in
social position above the ordinary freemen of the
district.</p>

<p>The <i>casa</i> and <i>curtis</i> of the Homo Francus alone
were protected by special clauses (XIX. and XX.),
and of him alone are any hints given as to kindred or
inheritance. Clause XLII., in the following few words,
enlightens us as to his social position:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If any Francus homo shall have sons, his inheritance in
woods and in land shall pass to them, and what there is in slaves
and cattle.</p>

<p>Concerning the maternal inheritance, let it go in like manner
to the daughter.</p>

</div>

<p>We must probably consider the privileged position
of the Homo Francus as presumably the result
of Frankish conquest. The great landowner may
have been the holder of a benefice, or a tenant <i>in
capite</i> placed upon the royal domain with ministerial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and judicial duties, and the triple wergeld may
fairly be assigned to his official position.</p>

<p>But to return to the wergelds.</p>

<p>The payment <i>pro fredo</i> seems to have been equal
to an additional one third of the wergeld.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Payment
for the
eye etc.
one quarter
the
wergeld.</div>

<p>From clauses XX. and XXXII. it appears that the
value of an eye or hand or foot was one quarter
of the wergeld, instead of half as in the Salic and
Ripuarian Laws.</p>

<p>Theft was to be paid for ninefold with four solidi
<i>pro fredo</i>.</p>

<p>The further clauses regarding theft in this border
district of forests and cattle and mixed population
are not quite easily understood, nor need we dwell
upon them.</p>

<p>In c. XXX. the penalty for letting a thief go without
bringing him before the Comes or centenarius was
60 solidi, as in the Ripuarian Laws.</p>

<h3>VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h3>

<p>Before passing from the laws, the compilation
of which seems to date from the conquests of
Charlemagne, it may be well to note that, regarded
from the point of view of the wergelds, the tribes
whose customs have been examined in the last two
sections seem to have belonged to the Frankish
group with wergelds of 200 gold solidi, while on
the other hand the Frisians and Saxons seem to
have belonged to the other group with wergelds of
160 gold solidi.</p>

<p>This grouping of the tribes may not be exactly
what might have been expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The two
groups of
tribes with
wergelds
of 200 and
160 solidi.</div>

<p>Geographically the Frankish group is sufficiently
compact. The other is widely extended and
scattered. Frisians and Saxons remain in their
ancient homes. The Alamannic, Bavarian, and
Burgundian tribes have wandered far away from
theirs. But in their northern home they may have
been once sufficiently contiguous to have shared
many common customs and among them a common
wergeld of 160 solidi.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Settled in their new quarters,
the Rhine and its tributaries seem to have been the
great highways of commercial intercourse and the
connecting links between them. Immigrants from
them all met as strangers (<i>advenæ</i>) in the Ripuarian
district, and, as we have seen, we owe our knowledge
of some of their wergelds very much to the recognition
of them in the Ripuarian law.</p>

not detain the reader very long.</p>

<p>The weight system applied to gold and silver was
that evidently derived from the Eastern Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marks,
ores, and
ortugs.
The ortug
the Greek
stater or
ox-unit.</div>

<p>It consisted of the mark, the ore, and the ortug.
The mark was divided into eight ores or ounces, and
the ore or ounce into three ortugs, which were in fact
staters or double solidi. The ounce being the Roman
ounce of 576 wheat-grains, the ortug contained 192
wheat-grains, and was the exact counterpart in wheat-grains
of the Greek stater, <i>i.e.</i> Professor Ridgeway’s
ox-unit. Reckoned in wheat-grains, two Scandinavian
marks of 8 ounces were, as we have seen,
exactly equal to what the early metrologists called
the (light) <i>Mina Attica</i>, which consisted of 16 Roman
ounces or 9216 Roman wheat-grains. Four gold
marks thus made a <i>heavy</i> gold mina, traditionally
representing a normal wergeld of 100 head of cattle.</p>

<p>But this heavy gold Mina of four marks had
been seemingly twisted from its original Greek
character to bring it into consistency with Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
methods of reckoning. It was divided no longer into
100 staters, but now into 96 ortugs, so as to make
the ortug double of the solidus and one third of the
Roman ounce, thus throwing it out of gear, so to speak,
with the normal tribal wergelds of 100 head of cattle.
It was thus made to contain only 96 ox-units, although
in actual weight its 32 Roman ounces really did contain,
so long as the standard of the Roman ounce
was adhered to, 100 Attic staters or ox-units.</p>

<p>That the light mina of two marks or 9216 wheat-grains
had found its way by the Eastern trade routes
into Scandinavia appears from its survival in the
monetary system of countries on both sides of the
Baltic to quite modern times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
pound
of two
marks.</div>

<p>In Northern Europe the pound of twelve ounces
was not, as elsewhere, the usual larger unit. The
pound of two marks or sixteen ounces had taken its
place. And except in Norway and Denmark, which
sooner or later adopted the monetary and weight
system of Charlemagne, the ounce remained the
Roman ounce of 576 wheat-grains. At the same time,
as in the case of the Merovingian system, in spite of the
Imperial influence of the gold solidus, there were
evident marks of a tendency towards the ancient
Eastern standard of the stater rather than the heavier
standard of the double solidus. The ortug of 192
wheat-grains seems to have often sunk in actual
weight below even the Attic weight to that of the
ancient Eastern stater of 8·18 grammes.</p>

<p>Thus when the Russian weight system was
recorded in the time of Peter the Great the unit both
for precious metals and goods was found to be the
<i>Zolotnic</i> or gold piece. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>Here, then, <i>in wheat grains</i> the Funt is the light
Mina Attica over again, Romanised in its divisions.
The Zolotnic is the solidus or half-stater. But in
actual weight the pound is exactly half of the ancient
Eastern gold mina of 818 grammes.</p>

<p>The Pfund of Silesia (Breslau), according to Martini,
was 405 grammes, and that of Poland (Cracow) the
same. Only Sweden and Riga seem to have adopted
or preserved higher standards, the double mark of
Sweden being 425 and that of Riga 419 grammes;
but even these fell far short of the standard weight
of 16 Roman ounces, viz. 436 grammes. But
throughout, low as the standard of the Baltic <i>Funts</i>
or double marks may have been, they were divided
according to the Roman commercial weight system
into <i>ores</i> or ounces and <i>loths</i> or half-ounces, and
<i>gwentschen</i> or drachmas of one eighth of an ounce,
just as if they were of full Imperial weight. The
marks and the ores remained, but the old division
of <i>ores</i> into ortugs or staters had long ago disappeared.</p>

<p>The division into marks, ores, and ortugs was,
however, in full force at the time of the Norse laws,
both for gold and silver. And the evidence of actual
weights seems to show, not only that for the purposes
of the Eastern trade routes, reckoning in
marks, ores, and ortugs was in common use, but also
that the standard, like that of the Merovingian coinage,
was the ancient Eastern standard.</p>

<p>Thus the following weights, believed to belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the Viking period, from the island of Gotland, are
now in the Royal Museum at Stockholm (Nos. 4752
and 5984).</p>

<p>The unit of these weights is exactly the Eastern

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether this standard had been arrived at
independently of the Merovingian standard, or
adopted from it, we must not stop to inquire. It is
enough that the ortug at the date of the laws through
Roman influence had come to be reckoned as one
third of the ounce.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the early Byzantine
influences and that of Eastern trade routes, long before
the date of the Norse laws, Scandinavia had
come under Frankish influences also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mark
of 8
Roman
ounces
and Charlemagne’s
mark of
the <i>nova
moneta</i>.</div>

<p>Already during Merovingian times, chiefly through
the Frisian mint at Duurstede, Merovingian currency
had become well known on the Baltic, and we have
seen that the first Scandinavian coins were copies
from those of the Duurstede type. Hence it came to
pass that in the most ancient of the Norse laws the
old Scandinavian reckoning in gold and silver marks,
ores, and ortugs had become connected with the
Frankish currency. During the period of Merovingian
influence the Merovingian ounce and the
Norse ore were both, reckoned in wheat-grains, the
ounce of the Roman pound, whatever may have been
their actual weight. The mark of eight ounces
contained 4608 wheat-grains of gold or silver. But
at last, as the result of Charlemagne’s conquests
in the North, his <i>nova moneta</i> with its higher standard
was brought into contact with Scandinavia. His
mark of eight of his ounces or 5120 wheat-grains
ultimately superseded in Norway and Denmark
the old mark of eight Roman ounces. Hence,
as all the Scandinavian laws as we have them, are
of later date than Charlemagne’s conquests, the
question must arise, which of the two marks is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
one in which the wergelds and other payments are
described.</p>

<p>In the oldest Norse laws the wergelds are stated
mostly in <i>silver</i> marks, ores, and ortugs. The ratio
between gold and silver was 1:8, so that an ore of
gold equalled a mark of silver, and thus the translation
of silver values into gold is easy. The laws
themselves, as we shall find, make this perfectly
clear. A wergeld stated as of so many gold marks
is divided in the details of payment into silver marks,
ores, and ortugs at the ratio of 1:8.</p>

<h3>II. THE WERGELDS OF THE GULATHING AND
FROSTATHING LAWS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The
Gulathing
law.</div>

<p>In approaching the consideration of the Scandinavian
custom as to wergelds and the structure of
tribal society as disclosed in the ancient laws, I do it
with great diffidence, especially as, for the translation
of Old Norse, I am dependent on others.</p>

<p>On the whole it seemed best to concentrate attention
upon the <i>Gulathingslög</i> as the oldest of the Norse
laws. The Danish and Swedish laws and the Grágás
of Iceland no doubt under competent hands would
yield valuable additional evidence, but the oldest of
the Norse laws may probably be fairly taken as the
most representative of early Northern custom, and at
the same time most nearly connected with the object
of this inquiry.</p>

<p>Geographically the Gulathing law was in force in
the southern portion of Norway. It seems to have
embraced, in about the year 930, three, and afterwards
six, <i>fylkis</i> or districts each with its own <i>thing</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and local customs.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> In this respect it resembled the
Frisian and Saxon laws, both of which recognised, as
we have seen, the separate customs of tribal divisions
contained in the larger district over which the laws
had force.</p>

<p>The Gulathing law must therefore be regarded as
in some sense a compilation or collection of customs
rather than one uniform law. For instance, there are
three or four separate descriptions of the wergeld
and the modes of its payment and receipt. One of
these is avowedly of later date. The older ones may
probably describe local variations of general custom,
belonging to one or another of the divisions, and even
these bear marks of later modification and additions.</p>

<p>As usual, the introduction of Christianity was the
occasion and perhaps the cause of the compilation,
and therefore from the time of the formation of
Dioceses by King Olaf (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1066-93) ecclesiastical
influence must be expected. But on the whole this
Gulathing law presents in some points a far more
interesting and instructive picture of social conditions
resulting from tribal custom than the laws of other
tribes already examined of much earlier date.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Frostathing
law.</div>

<p>The next important of the ancient laws of Norway
is the <i>Frostathingslög</i> belonging to the more northerly
district of Drontheim. Without pretending to have
made it the subject of special study, I have here and
there found it useful in elucidation of the Gulathing
law, and as showing that tribal custom, though with
local variations, was in force over a wider district than
that under the Gulathing law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of the structure of tribal society and
the division of classes in Norway may be most
conveniently approached from the point of view
of the <i>rett</i> or ‘personal right,’ somewhat analogous
to the Irish ‘honour-price’ and the Welsh ‘saraad.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grades of
personal
‘rett.’</div>

<p>Both in the Gulathing law and in the Frostathing
law this personal ‘rett’ lies at the root of the
graduated payments for insults, wounding, and
homicide. And the statements of it are practically
identical in the two laws. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The chief difference is that the Frostathing law
divides the leysings into two classes, a significant
point on which important considerations turn.</p>

<p>The things for which full rett was paid may be
described as insults. If a man were knocked down,
even if he fell on his knees, or if his moustache were
‘seized with hostile hand’ (195), or if a man were
called ‘a mare or bitch,’ these were insults for which
full rett was to be paid (196).</p>

<p>The payments for inflicting serious wounds (sár)
were regulated in the same gradations according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
rank as the rett, but were threefold in amount. These
payments were made in ‘baugs’ or rings, each of
twelve ores of silver.</p>

<p>These were the penalties paid by the person
inflicting the wound&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> <i>three times his own rett</i>&mdash;and

<p>Here the writer clearly refers back to the ancient
Frostathing book as the authority for the ‘lawful
bót,’ but on examination he seems to add certain
additional bóts which the courts now include in the
round amount of so many gold marks awarded by
them in each case as it comes before them.</p>

<p>The writer takes first the case of an award of
six marks of gold and describes how it is to be
divided, and then the case of five marks of gold, and
so on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Division
of it in
silver
marks at
ratio of
1:8.</div>

<p>The division is throughout made in <i>silver</i> marks,
ores, ortugs, and penningar. But when the items are
added up, the total in silver divided at the ratio of
1:8 brings back the result as nearly as may be to
the number of <i>gold marks</i> from which the division
started. Thus in the clause describing the division
of the wergeld of six marks of gold, the silver items
add up to 48 marks exactly, and the division of this
by 8 brings back the amount to six marks of gold.
And so in the clause dividing five marks of gold, the
items seem to add up to one ortug only less than 40
silver marks, and again a division by 8 brings the
amount sufficiently near to five marks of gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The group
of Bauga
men. The other
group of
Nefgildi-men.</div>

<p>In each case, however, the writer adheres to the
same scheme of division. When he has 6 gold marks
to divide he first assigns 18 silver marks to <i>Bauga</i>
men (<i>i.e.</i> the near group of kinsmen of male descent
on the paternal side only), and then he adds half as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
much (<i>i.e.</i> 9 marks) to a group of <i>Nefgildi-men</i><a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> among
whom are included, with others, kinsmen of descent
through females on both paternal and maternal sides.
So that these two groups of Bauga men and Nefgildi
get 27 marks. In all cases he makes the group of
Nefgildi receive only half the amount received by
the Bauga group, the whole amount being reduced
according to the number of gold marks to be divided.
After the amount allowed to these two groups, the
remainder is made up of additional payments some of
which he expressly declares were not included under
old law. Thus (in clause 6) he adds an amount
which he says was ‘not found in the old Frostathing
book’ and justifies it by saying that there would be
danger to the slayer if it was not paid. And so
again (in clause 9), there are additions for half-brothers,
half-brothers’ sons, &amp;c., of the same mother.
And these additions are included in the six marks of
gold ‘according to new law.’</p>

<p>Evidently, therefore, we must not take these
wergelds of six and five marks of gold with their
divisions as representing the ancient customary
wergelds of this class or that in the social scale, but
rather as showing the extent to which the system
of wergelds had become somewhat arbitrarily
expanded and elastic in later times. The total
amount with additions was apparently increasing as
time went on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later
statement
in the
Gulathing
law.</div>

<p>As in the Frostathing law so also in the Gulathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
law (clause 316, p. 104) there is a statement of
wergeld, avowedly of a late date and added under
the name of <i>Biarne Marðarson</i>, who lived about
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1223. And this, too, seems to belong to a
time when the amount of the wergeld was awarded
by some public authority in so many marks of gold.
He takes the case of a wergeld of six marks of gold
and shows how it ought to be divided; and then
the case of a wergeld of five marks of gold and shows
how that should be divided&mdash;‘What each shall take
of five marks of gold’ and so on&mdash;just as was done
by the writer in the Frostathing law.</p>

<p>One might have supposed from this that, as the
method of awarding fixed amounts and the amounts
to be divided in gold marks were the same, so the
groups and the persons included in them would have
corresponded also. But they differ considerably.</p>

<p>Biarne Marðarson up to a certain point follows
the same scheme as the writer in the Frostathing.</p>

<p>In his division of six marks of gold he, too, draws
a line at the amount of 27 marks, and he also divides
this amount into thirds and gives two thirds to one
group and one third to the other. The son of the
slain and the brother of the slain form the first group
and take 18 marks, and a second group take 9 marks,
the two together taking 27 marks.</p>

<p>The group who together take 9 marks, like the
Nefgildi-men of the Frostathing, embraces however by
no means the same relatives as are included in the
latter. The only persons included are the father’s
brother and his children, <i>i.e.</i> first cousins or brœðrungs
of the slain, but among them are included the sons of
concubines and of female first cousins. And after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the mention of these is the statement, ‘<i>All that these
men take amounts to 27 marks and 2 aurar</i>.’ Out of
the remainder of the 6 gold marks or 48 silver marks
other relations take to the ‘fifth man’ on the male
line and the sixth on the female line.</p>

<p>Biarne Marðarson seems, like the writer in the
Frostathing law, to have had to some extent a free
hand in the division. It is clear that there was
much variety in the course adopted. Nor does he
seem to have been by any means so systematic and
accurate as the other writer. The silver amounts,
when added up, do not so accurately correspond
with the six gold marks to be divided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earlier
wergeld
of the
Gulathing
law. In
silver
marks and
cows.</div>

<p>We turn, then, from these later statements to what
seems likely to be an older statement of the Norse
wergeld, viz. that which commences at clause 218 of
the Gulathing law.</p>

<p>It describes the division of the wergeld of a
‘hauld’ or ‘odal-born’ man, and it begins with the
explanation that the ‘mannsgiöld’ or wergeld decreases
and increases from this as other retts.</p>

<p>It describes the various amounts both in silver
marks and in cows, which the other statements do
not, and this, so far as it goes, is a sign of antiquity.</p>

<p>In clause 223 is inserted a statement of the various
things in which wergelds may be paid. The only
item the value of which is given is the cow, which is
to be taken at 2½ ores if not older than eight winters
and if it be ‘whole as to horns and tail, eyes and
teats, and in all its legs.’ And this silver value of
the cow&mdash;2½ ores&mdash;is the one used in this older
description of the wergeld.</p>

<p>The wergeld according to this statement consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of bauga payments and upnám payments. The first
are received in three baugs or rings thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>After this statement is the declaration, ‘Now all
the baugs are counted.’</p>

<p>A clause is here interpolated changing the point
of view so as to show how, and by whom on the
slayer’s side the same three baugs were paid.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Nú scal vigande bœta syni

<p class="lang2of2">The slayer’s brother (if he has
one) shall pay to the brother of

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Nú scal brœðrongr viganda

<p class="lang2of2">The brœðrung of the slayer (if
he has one) shall pay to the
brœðrung of the slain the <i>brœðrungs

shall pay it.</p>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Sá er sunr hins dauða er við

<p class="lang2of2">He is [reckoned] the son of
the dead who takes the giöld,

however he is related.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Then follows the declaration, ‘<i>Now the baugs are
separated</i>’ (‘Nú ero baugar skildir’).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems clear, then, that the slayer was in the last
resort responsible for the whole of these baug payments,
as it was the son of the slain who would take
any part of them lapsing through failure of the
designated recipients.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Women’s
gifts.</div>

<p>The small payments to the mother, daughter,
sister, and wife included in the baug payments are
evidently additional and exceptional payments in
regard to close sympathy. The slayer does not make
these payments. It is expressly stated that they are
made ‘by the kinswomen of the slayer,’ but they are
included in the even amount of 20 marks or
64 cows.</p>

<p>The recipients of the three baugs, it will be seen,
were limited to the nearest relatives on the <i>paternal</i>
side&mdash;fathers, sons, brothers, and first cousins&mdash;with
no descent through females, while the recipients
in the next set of groups or ‘upnáms’ include also
relations through females: but, again, <i>only males
receive</i>.</p>

<p>There is, however, one exception. In clause 231
is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Nú ero konor þær allar er

sisters capable of bearing sons.

</div>

<p>Evidently they partake, as under Cymric custom,
only in respect of possible sons who if born would
partake themselves. Indeed, the sons only appear in
the list of receivers and in no case the mother, except
among the women’s gifts included as above in the
baug payments.</p>

<p>As in the Frostathing law the <i>nefgildi-men</i> took as
a group an amount equal to one half the amount of
the bauga group, so here the <i>upnám</i> men do the
same. Evidently this is the intention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld
of the
hauld at
1:8
200 gold
solidi,
or roundly,
100 cows.</div>

<p>Now if we may take the bauga payments and the
upnám payments as representing in intention 30 silver
marks or 96 cows, then, at a ratio of 1:8, the
30 silver marks equalled, in wheat-grains, exactly
200 Merovingian gold solidi.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> And this may have
been the ancient wergeld of the hauld.</p>

<p>There is, however, in clause 235 a further payment
mentioned extending ‘to the fifteenth degree
of kinship’ and amounting to about 1 mark and
3 ores. Possibly (though I hardly think it likely)
this formed a part of the original wergeld, and if it
be added, it would increase the wergeld to 31 marks,
5 ores, and at 2½ ores to the cow the wergeld would
be increased to 101⅕ cows. If we might take this as
roughly aiming at the round number of 32 marks and
100 cows, the wergeld of the hauld would be, at the
ratio of 1:8, four gold marks or 100 cows: <i>i.e.</i> in
actual weight the heavy gold mina of 32 Roman
ounces, which under Greek usage was divided into
100 staters or ox-units. The confusion between
96 and 100 cows is so likely a result of the application
of Roman methods to the division of the mina
that we need not regard it. That the one or the
other of these amounts may have been the original
wergeld of the hauld representing originally 100 cows
is consistent at least with widely spread tribal usage.</p>

<p>This view is confirmed by the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
further payments mentioned in the Gulathing are distinctly
abnormal ones, and so presumably added at a
later date like those mentioned in the Frostathing law.</p>

<p>We are justified in so considering them, because
in the laws themselves the persons to whom they
were made are expressly called <i>Sak-aukar</i>, or ‘additional
persons in the sak or suit.’ And when we
examine them further we find that they were hardly
likely to have been included among the original
recipients of the wergeld.</p>

<p>Among those of clause 236 are the thrallborn
brother and thrallborn son of the slain, and the half-brother
by the same mother; and clause 239 extends
the number to the son-in-law, brother-in-law, stepfather,
stepson, oath brothers, and foster brothers.
Evidently in these exceptional cases the rules of strict
blood relationship have been broken away from, and
additions have been made to the normal wergeld to
stay the vengeance of persons sufficiently nearly
connected in other ways to make them dangerous if
left unappeased.</p>

<p>It was probably these additional payments, added
from time to time in contravention of the strict rules
of blood relationship, which caused the uncertainty of
the later laws, and led to the new system of awarding
a round number of gold marks as the total wergeld,
included in which were additions intended to meet
the introduction of half-blood and foster relations and
others the risk of whose vengeance it seemed needful
apparently in later times to buy off.</p>

<p>Returning, then, to the original wergeld of the
hauld without these additions, we have seen that it
consisted of two sets of payments, bauga payments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and upnám payments, and possibly the small addition
of those of more distant relations.</p>

<p>Now in the Gulathing law there are two other
descriptions of the amount of the bauga payment,
and it will be useful to examine them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
statement
makes the
bauga
men pay
18 marks.</div>

<p>The first is to be found in clauses 179 and 180.</p>

<p>In clause 179 the payment for cutting off a hand
or foot and for striking out an eye is said to be a half
‘giöld,’ and it is added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">En ef allt er af einum manni
höggvit hönd oc fótr, þá er sá
verri livande en dauðr; scal
giallda sem dauðr sé.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">But if both hand and foot be
cut off the same man, he is worse
living than dead, and is to be paid
for as if he were dead.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>And then in the next clause, under the heading
‘<i>About Giöld</i>,’ is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Nú ero giölld töld í Gula;
giallda haulld xviii mörcom lögeyris.
Nú scolo þeðan giölld vaxa
oc svá þverra sem rétter aðrer.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Now shall be told payments in
Gula. A <i>hauld</i> shall be paid for
with 18 marks of lawful aurar.
Starting from this, the payments
shall increase or decrease
as other retts.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Now it would seem that this payment for the
death of a hauld was not the whole wergeld but only
the <i>bauga</i> part of it. No details even of the bauga
payments of eighteen marks are given in this clause.
It seems to be inserted in this place simply with
reference to the full limit of payments for injuries.
Liability for wounding, under Cymric custom, was
confined to the kinsmen of the gwely, and so it may
well be that under Norse custom it was confined to
the bauga group.</p>

<p>But the amount in this clause is only eighteen
marks, while that of the bauga payments of the
wergeld we have just been considering, as probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the earlier one, was twenty marks. How is this to
be accounted for? The answer surely must be that
eighteen marks of Charlemagne, reckoned in wheat-grains,
were exactly equal to twenty of the Roman or
Merovingian marks of the earlier period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
detailed
statement
makes the
bauga
payment
18 or 20
marks.</div>

<p>The other statement alluded to is also a statement
avowedly of the bauga payments, and begins
with almost the same words, ‘Now the giöld for
the hauld shall be told.’ In this case the details are
given and the detailed payments add up between
eighteen and nineteen marks, and yet the total is
given as a little more than twenty marks.</p>

<p>This statement differs from the older one in its
divisions, but it has an air of antiquity and reality
about it which suggests that it may represent a local
custom actually in force. Little touches of picturesque
detail seem to bring it into contact with actual
life, and to show how local custom might work out
a common object by its own peculiar method.</p>

<p>It meets us abruptly in clause 243 under the
heading ‘<i>On baugar</i>,’ and commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="poetry-container">

<i>tryggva-kaup</i> (truce-buying).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="lang2of2">Tryggva-kaup shall go between

</div>

</div>

<p>In the next clause it is explained that this ‘peace-price’
(<i>sættar-kaup</i>) is paid when the kinsmen come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
together to make peace, and that three marks are
also paid as <i>skógar-kaup</i>&mdash;‘forest price,’ <i>i.e.</i> payment
to release the slayer from being a <i>skógar-maðr</i>, or
outlaw living in the forest.</p>

<p>The slayer pays a <i>baug</i> to the son of the dead,
and two <i>truce-prices</i>, one to the brother and the other
to the ‘<i>brœðrung</i>’ of the dead. And the slayer’s
brother pays a <i>baug</i> to the brother of the slain and
again two truce-prices, one to the son of the slain and
the other to the <i>brœðrung</i> of the slain. And the
<i>brœðrung</i> of the slayer pays a <i>baug</i> to the <i>brœðrung</i>
of the slain and again two ‘truce-prices,’ one to the
son and the other to the brother of the slain. All this
is for peace-buying (<i>sættar-kaup</i>) when the kinsmen
are met together to make peace.</p>

<p>Then, in clause 245, the women’s gifts are described.
The slayer, his mother, his daughter, and
his wife each give a gift of 1⅕ ore to the wife, mother,
and daughter of the slain&mdash;making twelve gifts.
The sister of the slayer gives a half gift to the sister,
wife, daughter, and mother of the slain (two gifts),
and the slayer, his mother, wife, and daughter, each
give a half gift to the sister of the slain, making the
number of women’s gifts sixteen in all.</p>

<p>The amount aimed at seems to be 18 marks (the
upnám payments being 9 marks), and yet the total is
stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Now with <i>baugar</i> and with <i>tryggvakaup</i> and <i>skógar-kaup</i> and
women’s gifts it is 20 marks and 2⅖ ores.</p>

</div>

<p>Absolute accuracy need not be expected, but there
must be a reason for the difference between eighteen
and twenty marks&mdash;between the detailed payments
and the total&mdash;and it is difficult to suggest
any other than the one already mentioned.</p>

<p>The total amount of the bauga payments seems to
be the same in this as in the other statement, but a
new element is introduced with an obvious and
interesting object.</p>

<p>The bauga-men, as before, consist of three groups.
The slayer pays the <i>baug</i> to the son of the slain and
appeases the other two groups by payment to each
of them of a truce-price, so that to all the three bauga
groups of the relations of the slain he has acknowledged
his wrong and desire to make composition.
And so in each case the representative of the other
two groups of slayer’s relations pay the <i>baug</i> to the
corresponding group of the relatives of the slain and
a truce-price to the other two, so that no relation of
the slain could after this point to any individual as
not having joined in the payment to himself or his
group.</p>

<p>The women most deeply concerned on both sides
are also present at the gathering. And each of those
connected with the slayer is prepared with her gift
of 1⅕ ore for the corresponding relative of the person
slain.</p>

<p>Women’s gifts were included in the bauga payments
in the other statement also.</p>

<p>The clauses relating to the bauga payments are
followed by three others, headed ‘On saker,’ and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
further recipients of wergeld, as before, seem to be
divided into <i>upnáms</i> and <i>sakaukar</i>, but in this case
there is a strange mixture of the two. The mother’s
brother and the sister’s son are excluded from the
upnáms to make way for the half-brother by the same
mother of the thrallborn son.</p>

<p>Clause 246, ‘On saker,’ gives twelve ores to each
of the following, who in clause 250 are called <i>upnám</i>
men.</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">

<p>So that the bauga and upnám payments&mdash;two
thirds and one third&mdash;added together once more make
a normal wergeld of twenty-seven marks, that is, thirty
of the Merovingian standard.</p>

father’s brother and a thrallborn daughter’s son by a
kinborn father, take each a mark.</p>

<p>The traditional wergeld seems, therefore, once
more to be 27 marks of Charlemagne or 30 Merovingian
marks, and the additional payments appear to
be <i>sakaukar</i>. But the upnám group in this case
includes the brother by the same mother and the
thrallborn son, leaving outside as sakaukar the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Payments

<p>It is not within the scope of this inquiry to
attempt either to explain, or to explain away as of no
moment, the variations in the persons included under
the various schemes in the groups of bauga and
nefgildi or upnám men. Even such a question as
that of the exclusion from the upnám group of the
mother’s brother and the sister’s son, to make way for
the illegitimate half-brother and thrallborn son, is not
necessarily to be disposed of as a later alteration in
favour of those of illegitimate birth. For the Cymric
precedent might well lead us to an opposite conclusion,
inasmuch as in the laws of Howell, in spite of strong
ecclesiastical opposition, the ancient pagan custom of
admitting illegitimate sons to share in the father’s
inheritance was defended and retained as too fully
established to be given up.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Looked at from the
point of view of the feud, they were naturally more
on the spot and therefore of much more moment than
the mother’s brother or the sister’s son.</p>

<p>Professor Vinogradoff<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> has suggested that the
evidence of Norse and Icelandic wergelds seems to
point to an original organised group of agnates who
were bauga men and formed the kernel of the kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
liable for wergeld as contrasted with after additions
of relations on both paternal and maternal sides and
others more or less nearly concerned. The Cymric
precedent would lead us to expect to find thrallborn
sons as well as legitimate sons among the bauga men
without any special mention as such. Under Christian
influences they may have been excluded from this
group to find a place ultimately, sometimes with
special mention, in the upnám group.</p>

<p>It may or may not have been so, according to the
stage of moral growth arrived at in the particular
case of this tribe or that, at the particular period in
question. Hence, although under Norse custom the
amount of the normal wergeld of the hauld may
have been constant, the way in which it was divided
and the group responsible for its payment may well
have varied from time to time and in different
districts.</p>

<p>It has already been noticed that even under the
later methods of awarding as wergeld an even
number of gold marks, both the Gulathing and the
Frostathing laws, in the case of the award of 6 marks
of gold, draw a line, the one at 18 and 27 marks
and the other at 20 and 30 marks, as though these
amounts had a strong traditional sanction. Even in
the case of the lower awards the scheme of division
being the same with proportionately lessened figures,
this portion of the wergeld was always divided into
two thirds of bauga payments and one third of
nefgildi or upnám payments. This seems to be
strong evidence that, although the persons forming
the groups may have differed, the two groups formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
originally an inner and an outer kernel of the wergeld
proper, the additions to which may fairly be regarded
as sakaukar.</p>

<p>The repetition of evidence in both laws that the
bauga payment of two thirds was followed by
another third of nefgildi or upnám payments, when
connected with the further fact that the two together
made an amount which was, at the value of the cow
stated in the laws, equated with 96 or 100 cows,
seems to confirm the hypothesis that in this amount
we have the normal wergeld of the hauld. To
Professor Vinogradoff’s suggestion that the bauga
payments may have formed an original inner kernel
of the wergeld we may therefore perhaps add that
the nefgildi and upnám payments may have formed
an outer shell of the kernel, and that both may have
been included in the original normal wergeld of 96
or 100 cows.</p>

<p>Finally, if this may fairly be taken to be the
wergeld of the hauld, then, recurring to the repeated
statement in the Gulathing law that the wergeld of
the hauld being told, the wergelds of others ‘varied
according to the rett,’ the wergelds of the several

fair probability be stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The significance of these gradations in the retts
and wergelds of Norse tribal society will become
apparent in our next section.</p>

<h3>III. THE GRADATIONS OF SOCIAL RANK DISCLOSED BY
THE WERGELDS ETC.</h3>

<p>We are now able to devote attention to the interesting
question of the gradations in social rank under
Norse tribal custom. And we are fortunate to have
the guidance of Dr. Konrad von Maurer’s valuable
paper written in 1878 and entitled ‘Die Freigelassenen
nach altnorwegischem Rechte.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grades of
social rank
in the
churchyard.</div>

<p>Although tribal custom, viewed as we view it
after the acceptance of Christianity, may not be altogether
what it was originally in its actual working,
yet still it is worth while to seek for the principles
underlying the separating lines between social conditions
as revealed in the laws. So far as they can
be discovered, they are sure to be instructive, for
they cannot have been the result of the sudden change
in religion. Their roots at any rate go far back into
tribal custom, however much, as in other cases, the
Church may have adopted and modified what it could
not eradicate.</p>

<p>The hard lines of distinction between social
classes were kept up even in the churchyard.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="sidenote">The two
classes of
leysings or
freedmen
before and
after
making
‘freedom
ale.’</div>

<p>Referring to the gradations of <i>rett</i>, it will be seen
that there are apparently two classes of leysings,
whose social condition was next above the thrall at
the bottom of the ladder.</p>

<p>This was first made clear by Konrad von Maurer.
The thrall who by purchase or by gift had been made
a ‘freedman’ (frials-giafi) had only taken the first
step towards even that limited amount of freedom
which belonged to the leysing. Another step had to
be made good before he became a full leysing. And
the step was accomplished by the ceremony of
‘making his freedom ale.’</p>

<p>The leysing before ‘making his freedom ale’ was
still so far the property of his master that his
children did not inherit his goods. They belonged to
his master.</p>

either of them inherits from the
other. <i>Their children do not inherit
from them unless they make

</div>

</div>

<p>This passage shows that the link of blood-relationship
between two brothers and foster brothers, by
reason of their being fostered together, in the case of
thralls was recognised before that between parent
and child. It was the fosterage in this case which
had forged the link. Blood-relationship in thraldom
counted for nothing.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
leysing
must now
keep his
children.</div>

<p>The reason assigned in a clause above quoted for
the desire to ‘make freedom ale’ was that the leysing
might ‘have control of his bargains and his marriage.’
He gained, therefore, both as regards property and
also in family rights.</p>

<p>In Gulathing law (63) is described what happened
on his marriage. If he marries a kin-born (<i>ætt-borin</i>)
woman, and they afterwards separate, all the children
go with her. He, not being kin-born, has no kindred.
She being kin-born, her kindred have rights over her
and obligations as to her children.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If she die first, all the children

eat his property so long as it lasts,
and after it is all eaten up, all the
children shall go back to the

master</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>If one leysing marries another, and both father
and mother have made their freedom ale, the children
of the marriage inherit from both. This is the
beginning of the rights to inherit. But it is accompanied
by the obligation to keep the children, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
are no longer thralls of the master but leysings like
their parents.</p>

and cannot keep their children? Is the master to
keep them or are they to starve?</p>

</div>

<p>But it is not all leysing families which come to
this gruesome pass. It may be presumed that the
leysing who had ‘made his freedom ale’ and married
and could make his own bargains and keep what
property he and his wife could accumulate was mostly
prosperous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Children
could
inherit
from him,
but no
other kin.</div>

<p>In clause 106 the rules as to ‘leysing inheritance’
are described. If the leysing who ‘made his
freedom ale’ afterwards had children they could
inherit. But he had no other kin who could inherit:
so if he died childless the master took the property.
As generation after generation passed and a wider
kindred was formed, any one of his (the leysing’s)
kin took in preference to the master and his descendants.
But the rights or chances of inheritance on
the side of the master’s family did not cease for nine
generations from the first leysing who had ‘made his
freedom ale.’ So that if a leysing even of the eighth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
generation died without kin the inheritance in this
extreme case went to the descendants of the master of
the first leysing ‘to the ninth knee’ rather than pass
by failure of kin to the king.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang2of2">(G. c. 106.) A leysing’s inheritance
shall be taken to the
ninth knee before it falls to the
king. When a leysing’s son takes
after his father, then let one take
after the other. If in a leysing’s
kin there comes to be an ‘all-dead’
inheritance, and no one
has inheritance-right after the
deceased man of the leysing’s kin,
then one of his master’s kin shall
take to the ninth knee before it
falls to the king, even though the
deceased man be the eighth from
the leysing.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Further
steps into
freedom at
stages of
three generations.</div>

<p>Thus we seem to see the family of the leysing
who had ‘made his freedom ale’ gradually growing
up into a kindred in successive stages until in the
ninth generation a kindred of leysings had been fully
formed and might be very numerous.</p>

<p>In the corresponding clause in the Frostathing
law (IX. 11) further details are mentioned. If not
previously purchased by agreement with the master,
the ‘<i>thyrmsl</i>’ came to an end after four generations:
that is, the fifth generation was free from them.
They lasted, therefore, over the first four generations
from the original leysing to his great-grandchildren.
For these four generations the leysing and his descendants
were the leysings of the master and his
descendants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At the
ninth generation
the lordship
over
them
ceases.</div>

<p>Then the clause goes on to show that the first
leysing having ‘made his freedom ale’ shall take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
inheritance only of his son and daughter, and of his
own freedman. The sons of this leysing take inheritance
from six persons, viz. father, mother, sons,
daughters, brothers, sisters, and, seventhly, from any
freedman of their own.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

</div>

</div>

<p>Failing these leysing claimants, the inheritance
rights revert to the master to the ninth knee, and, it
is added, ‘<i>also providing for these if needed</i>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analogy of
the
Cymric
gwely.</div>

<p>There is here something very much like the
Cymric gwely or family of descendants of a great-grandfather
with rights of maintenance under the
rules of ‘<i>tir gwelyauc</i>’ and mutual liability. Until
a kindred has been formed the master’s obligation to
provide for the leysing remains, and it does not cease
altogether until the kindred is complete. In the
meantime as the kindred is formed its members are
mutually liable for each other’s maintenance. In this
respect within the group of descendants of a great-grandfather
there is solidarity for maintenance as
well as wergeld.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lordship
over
them
ceases
when a
full kindred
is
formed.</div>

<p>We are dealing evidently here with a family of
leysings growing into a kindred, as under Cymric
custom the family of the Aillt and Alltud grew into
a kindred. During all these four generations the
family were leysings with a <i>rett</i> of six ores. But
the fifth generation seems to rise into a second grade
of social rank and to attain the rank of ‘<i>leysings’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sons</i>’ with a <i>rett</i> of eight ores. And further in another
four generations, those of the ninth generation again
rise in social rank and seem to become <i>árborinn</i> or
<i>ættborinn</i> men, <i>i.e.</i> <i>men born in a kindred</i>, with a <i>rett</i> of
sixteen ores. They can now boast of a full leysing
kindred. Their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather
were born in a kindred, and they have now
full rights of inheritance. The master and his descendants
have no further hold on them or obligation
for their maintenance. Any lapsed inheritance
now goes direct to the king.</p>

<p>The <i>árborinn</i> or <i>ættborinn</i> man, therefore, seems at
last, at the moment when a full kindred of his own
has risen up to swear for him and protect him by
feud or wergeld, to have become clear from any
claims on the master’s side. And accordingly if any
claim be set up he has to prove his freedom by witnesses
‘that he can count four of his forefathers as
<i>árborinn</i> men and himself the fifth.’ That is, he
shows that his great-grandfather was a man with an
<i>ætt</i> or kindred. If he can prove this he is free from
any claim in regard to his leysing descent.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang2of2">(Frostathing, IX. 10.) But if
the accused calls himself <i>árborinn</i>
<i>let him reckon up four of his
forefathers as árborinn men</i>, he
being the fifth himself, and have
for it the evidence of two árborinn
householders. But if he is so
supportless that he does not get
this, and yet sets up this defence
[viz. that he is árborinn], then
he shall prove his kin to be
árborinn by ordeal. And if he is
cleared by iron or evidence, the
other shall pay him full atonement,
and to the bishop an oath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
fine. If he cannot clear himself,
he has forfeited all his property
to his master, and is liable to pay
three marks in silver, unless he
work it off. The same applies to
a <i>vánar mann</i> [man of hope, <i>i.e.</i>
the higher class of leysing].</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>So far the conclusions drawn from the laws respecting
the leysing do not vary much from the
views expounded by Dr. Konrad von Maurer in his
‘Die Freigelassenen nach altnorwegischem Rechte,’
and confirmed by so great an authority they can
hardly have wandered very far from the truth.</p>

<p>The theory of this gradual growth of the kindred
of the leysing is so nearly analogous to that of the
Cymric alltud, and the Irish fuidhir, and at the same
time so logical, when the tribal theory of blood-relationship
is applied to it, that we cannot be dealing
with the fanciful theory of legal enthusiasts which
never had an actual place in practical life. Behind
all this imperfect description, in the laws, of social
conditions and landholding there was, no doubt, a
reality, the features of which may be difficult to
grasp from our modern point of view, but which
become, I think, fairly intelligible when approached
from a tribal point of view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
leysings
have
become a
family
group, and
the
descendants
of the
master
also.</div>

<p>When we consider that in the course of the successive
generations, during which some kind of shadowy
lordship seems to have prevailed over the family of
leysings, they must generally have multiplied into
considerable numbers, and that the descendants of
the master of the leysing ‘who made freedom ale’
must during the same period also have multiplied;
and further when we consider that the descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of the leysing were in some sense, it would seem,
<i>adscripti glebæ</i>, we have to recognise not merely a
relation between individuals but something approaching
to a relation between two classes, tribesmen and
non-tribesmen, the one in some sense in a kind of
servitude to the other. In other words, we have to
conceive of a kindred of half-free tenants, living
under the joint shadowy lordship of a kindred of
fully-free men, probably in some tribal sense landowners,
with complicated tribal rights among themselves.</p>

<p>It would seem that this semi-subject class of
leysings were mostly the descendants of a class of
thralls, it may be perhaps in origin some conquered
race, members of which had gradually grown into
leysings and were now gradually in successive stages
growing into freemen.</p>

<p>Before we can fully understand this process we
must examine the other side of the question and
learn what was the position of the fully-free class by
whom this more or less shadowy lordship over the
leysing class was exercised. In the meantime it may
be remarked that the shadowy lordship of one class
or tribe over another finds parallels enough in Indian
experience, and that, coming nearer home, we have
only to remember the petty exactions of the cadets
of French noble families upon a peasantry over
whom their family, or the feudal head of it, held a
quasi-manorial lordship.</p>

<h3>IV. THE CLASSES OF FREE MEN AND THEIR RELATION
TO LAND.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The odalman
or
hauld.</div>

<p>Following again the clue of the statements of the
‘personal right’ of the different classes, and commencing
with the <i>bónde</i> or ordinary freeman settled
upon land and presumably having in some sense, as
in Wales, originally tribal rights to share in the land
or its use, the next class which claims attention
above the bónde is the <i>odalman</i> or odalborn man or
hauld, whose wergeld of 96 or 100 cows was taken
as that of the full and typical freeman.</p>

<p>Now, in the Frostathing law there is a statement
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Engum manni verðr iörð at
óðali fyrr en .iij. langfeðr hafa
átt, oc kemr undir hinn .iiij. samfleytt.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(XII. 4.) No man’s land becomes
an odal to him until <i>three
forefathers</i> have owned it and it
falls to the fourth in unbroken
succession.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>And again in the Gulathing law is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Nu scal þær iarðer telia er
óðrlom scolo fylgia. Sú er ein er
ave hever ava leift.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(270.) Now shall the lands
be told that are odal. The first
is the one which <i>grandfather</i> has
left to <i>grandfather</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">His grandfather’s
grandfather
had
the land.</div>

<p>The odalborn man inherits land from his grandfather’s
grandfather. The son of an odalman who
claims odal as odal by inheritance counts four or five
forefathers who had the land before him.</p>

<p>In Gulathing law c. 266 is a description of the
mode of settling a claim as to land. It describes the
sitting of the open-air court, from which both
bauggildsmen and nefgildsmen and relations by marriage
of the claimant are excluded as ineligible, the
calling of witnesses all to be odalborn men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
same fylki as that in which the land lies, and so on.
The validity of the claim is made to rest according
to this statement upon the ability to count up <i>five
forefathers who have possessed that land, while the sixth
possessed it both by ownership and by odal</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Þeir scolo telia til langfeðra
sinna .v. er átt hava, en sá hinn
sétti er bæðe átte at eign oc at
óðrle.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(266.) They [the men who
claim odal] shall count five of
their forefathers who have owned
[the land] and the sixth having it
both in ownership and odal.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The odalmen
were
of full kindred
on
the land.</div>

<p>If, then, at the time of the laws we look at the
class of landowners who were prominent as odalmen
or haulds&mdash;typical men with wergelds originally of
100 cows&mdash;they were not only men of full <i>kindred</i>
whose full pedigree of freedom went back the necessary
nine generations, but their grandfather’s grandfather
must have possessed the land. The sixth
generation of owners were the first to hold land <i>both
in ownership and odal</i>.</p>

<p>The steps in the rank of Norse aristocracy were
marked, therefore, as in the case of the more dependent
class, by the number of the generations of
ancestors through whom they could claim their
landed rights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The odal
land was
held by
a family
and subject
to
family
divisions.</div>

<p>Nor in the case of the odalborn man any more
than in the case of the leysing must we look upon
the odalman or hauld merely as a detached
individual landowner owning his own separate
estate like a modern country squire. Such a conception
would be far indeed from the truth. It must
be remembered that holdings in odal were subject to
rules of division. Moreover, indications appear in
the laws that the division was not merely one between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the heirs of a single holder, but something more like
what took place between the group of kinsmen in
the case of the Cymric gwely and ‘<i>tir gueliauc</i>.’
How otherwise can this clause be read?</p>

<p>At the time of the laws owners of odal had, it
appears, certain powers of selling their odal, but even
then it was not an uncontrolled right of a man to do
what he would with his own. His first act must be to
‘go to the “thing” in autumn and offer it to his <i>odal-sharers</i>’
(<i>odalsnautr</i>, one who has odal-right to land
in common with others). (G. 276.)</p>

<p>If a man buys without its having been thus offered,
then ‘the odal-sharers may break that bargain’
(G. 277). Even when the sale and purchase have
been made by the public ceremony of <i>skeyting</i>, <i>i.e.</i> by
taking earth from the four corners of the hearth and
from under the ‘high seat,’ and where field and
meadow meet, and with witnesses at the ‘thing’ (G.
292), the <i>odal-sharers</i> of the seller have the right to
redeem it within a twelvemonth (G. 278).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The odal-sharers

<p>Take, again, the case of two brothers dividing
odal, and observe how careful law and custom had
been to prevent either of the odal-shares going out of
the family. The odal rights between them were
maintained for as many generations as must pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
before the shares could be united again by a lawful
marriage between a son of one family and a daughter
of the other (G. 282). One is tempted to say that
here again there may be something very much like
the Cymric gwely and to suppose that marriage was
forbidden within the gwely, <i>e.g.</i> between second
cousins, and that the odal sharing continued so long as
the gwely held together.</p>

as to be <i>nefgildi</i> or <i>bauggildi</i>’&mdash;that is, as we have

great-grandparents&mdash;have a right to redeem it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
their kinswoman at one-fifth less than its value,
‘paying one half in gold and silver and the rest in
thralls and cattle.’ The men then keep the odal and
their kinswoman ‘keeps the aurar.’ Even if odal
has passed ‘three times under the spindle’ it comes
back at last to the male kinsmen (275).</p>

spring from a tribal principle which lies at the root
of tribal polity. The solidarity of kindreds, taken together
with the liability of individuals to take their
share in the payments for which their kindred is
responsible, corresponds to the solidarity of odal landholding,
taken together with the individual rights of
the odal-sharers. Unless every one in a kindred had
his recognised tribal rights on the land, unless he
were possessed of cattle and rights of grazing for their
maintenance, how could he pay his quota of cattle to
the hauld’s wergeld of 100 cows? The two things
seem to hang together as in the Cymric instance, and
the one makes the other possible.</p>

<h3>V. THE LEX SCANIA ANTIQUA.</h3>

<p>The ‘Lex Scania Antiqua’ might perhaps be
selected as fairly typical of Danish<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> ancient custom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
as the Gulathing has been taken as typical of Norse
custom. But apart from this it contains some
chapters which seem to throw further light on odal
and family holding, and so can hardly be overlooked
in this inquiry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Latin
and old
Danish
versions of
Scanian
law.</div>

<p>There are two versions of the Scanian Law, one
in Latin and the other in old Danish. They differ
considerably and are certainly not translations one
of the other, though an older text may have been the
foundation of them both.</p>

<p>They both refer to recently made modifications
of local custom which fix their date to the early
years of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The author of the Latin text was the Archbishop
of Lund (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1206-1215), and from the use made by
him of legal terms borrowed more or less from
Roman law it may be gathered that Scanian custom
required for him more explanation than the Danish
writer deemed it necessary to give.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The rules with regard to wergelds cannot be
quoted as representing unmodified ancient custom.
They avowedly are the result of modifications made
to remedy evils which had arisen partly, no doubt,
from the gradual loosening of the ties of kindred.</p>

<p>In the same way the clauses as to property
represent the results of long-continued conflict
between ancient rules of family holding and gradual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
innovations in the direction of individual ownership.
In this they resemble the Lex Salica. Still if family
holdings more or less on the lines of the Cymric
gwely, or the Salic alod, had once been the prevalent
form of occupation, even new rules making alterations
could hardly fail to reveal traces of older custom.
The special value to this inquiry of the ‘Lex Scania
antiqua’ is that it does so.</p>

<p>Disguised as some of these traces may be in the
Latin text, under Roman phraseology, with the
Danish version at hand it ought not to be difficult
to recognise the meaning of the facts disclosed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When
there was
arrangement
on
marriage
widow
took half
of their
joint
property
if no
children.</div>

<p>The first chapter relates to the rights of a wife
surviving her husband when there are no children of
the marriage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Omnia que in hereditate sunt
mobilia, vel se moventia,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> vel immobilia,
precio tempore matrimonii
comparata, equis sunt
partibus dividenda, medietate
heredes defuncti proximos cum
prediis que propria ipsius fuerant
et uxorem altera cum suis prediis
contingente.…</p>

<p class="lang2of2">All things in the <i>hereditas</i>
which are moveable or cattle or
immoveable, brought in by value
fixed at the time of the marriage,
are to be divided in equal parts,
one part appertaining to the next
heirs of the deceased [husband]
with the lands which were his
own, and the other part to the
wife together with her lands.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This clause may very possibly represent an
extension of the rights of a childless widow beyond
what tribal custom may have originally given her.
But certainly the fact that under Scanian law the
childless widow was entitled to half of what by compact
at the time of the marriage had become the joint
property of husband and wife, while the other half
went to the husband’s next heirs, is good evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
that marriage was by no means a surrender of the
wife and her property once for all into the power of
the husband and his family. And evidence of the
accord of Scandinavian with other tribal custom on
this point is not without value.</p>

<p>It may be observed, however, that in the case
mentioned there had been something like a compact
or valuation of the property brought under the
marriage arrangement at the time of the marriage.
The result might therefore have been different if no
special compact had been made. The inference
might well be that the childless widow in that case
would not have been allowed to take her half share
with her away from her husband’s kindred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Family
holding
vested in
the grandfather
as
<i>paterfamilias</i>.</div>

<p>Chapter III. refers again to a wife’s property and
adds important information. It brings before us a
family group with something like a family holding.
And it becomes intelligible only, I think, when
approached from this point of view.</p>

<p>Into this family group a wife has been brought
apparently without the special ‘definition’ or arrangement.
There are also children of the marriage.
And the question asked in the heading of the Latin
text is, what shares the grandchildren take on their
father’s death, not in their parent’s property, but in
the property of the grandfather.</p>

<p>The grandfather is the head of the family group.
In the Latin version he is elsewhere styled the <i>paterfamilias</i>
and in this clause his sons are <i>filiifamilias</i>.</p>

<p>In the Danish version the family group is simply
that of an ordinary <i>bonde</i> and the family character
of the holding is taken for granted as not needing
special mention or explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The chapter is as follows (divided into sections
for convenience in comparison of the Latin and
Danish texts):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="sidenote">If no
arrangement
on
marriage
wife’s
property
merged
into the
family
stock.</div>

<p>This clause, in both the Latin and the Danish version,
confirms the inference from the previous one,
that there was a difference of destination as to the
property of husband and wife according to whether
it had or had not been ‘defined’ and so put in partnership
as joint property of the husband and wife
separately from the property of the family group
represented by the grandfather.</p>

<p>If not so defined, it became apparently under
ancient custom part of the common family property
and so divisible after the grandfather’s death among
all the <i>consortes</i> instead of going solely to the children
of the marriage.</p>

<p>The clause pictures for us the family group as
bound together by paternal rites (<i>sacris paternis</i>).
The grandfather is alive and is the <i>paterfamilias</i>.
A son who is a <i>filiusfamilias</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, as we shall see
presently, not an emancipated son) has married and
brought into the <i>mansio</i>, or family homestead of the
grandfather, property which he had with his wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
This, not having been ‘defined’ on marriage, so as
to keep it separate, has become, in the phrase of the
Latin text, ‘added to the property of the grandfather.’
The husband has died leaving several sons, it matters
not how many. The question is, what share these
grandsons are to take in the property which their
father had with their mother, which, for want of
‘definition,’ has become added to the grandfather’s
property, or, in other words, become part of the
‘<i>substantia communis</i>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">There was
no succession
by
representation
to a
deceased
parent
during the
grandfather’s
lifetime.</div>

<p>The answer is that the parents’ property does not
go exclusively to their children as it would have
done if it had been defined and separate property.
It has become merged in the family property, and
there is no sharing of this till the grandfather’s death.
But apparently by a compromise, due probably to
recent legislation, they are allowed on their father’s
death, according to the Latin text, to take equal
shares in his property <i>per capita</i> ‘with the grandfather
and other <i>consortes</i>,’ or, according to the
Danish text, a ‘full lot’ in it. We are not told
who were the ‘<i>consortes</i>’ with whom and the grandfather
it was to be shared. The <i>consortes</i>, whether
uncles or cousins or both, were the co-sharers in the
‘<i>communis substantia</i>’ of the family holding.</p>

<p>In the final paragraph of the clause both texts
give the alternative rule applying to cases, probably
the most frequent, in which proper ‘definition’
of the wife’s property had been made on the marriage.
And the rule is stated to be that the property so
defined and made joint or partnership property on
the marriage, and that alone (<i>illa sola</i>), would go to
the children of the marriage at their father’s death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
during the life of the grandfather. According to
the Latin text, they were excluded from the other
family property ‘by the prior grade.’ As the
Danish version puts it: ‘not a whit of the other
property would they get except what the grandfather
chose to give them.’</p>

<p>That this is the true meaning of these clauses
is confirmed by other chapters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Permission
to
the grandfather
to
give succession
to
a deceased
son’s
children.</div>

<p>Chapter XVI. is headed: ‘How much may be
conferred by a father upon the sons of a deceased
son during the lives of the other sons, their uncles.’
The text is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Licet cuique post mortem filii
quantum ipsi deberetur si viveret,
ejus filio nepoti conferre.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">It is lawful to every one after
the death of a son to confer upon
a grandson, the son of that son,
whatever would have been due to
the son had he lived.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This seems to be a special permission to the grandfather
during his life to mitigate the injustice of the
customary rule excluding grandchildren from succession
by representation in their deceased parent’s
property.</p>

<p>If under Scanian custom the children of a dead
<i>filiusfamilias</i> had succeeded by right to their father’s
property, this special permission would not have been
needed. But it seems to be clear that no such right
of succession was recognised by ancient custom.</p>

<p>Chapter XI. opens with the following general
statement, there being in this case no question of a
marriage or a wife’s property.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Otherwise
no succession
given
by custom.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Patre superstite defunctus
filiusfamilias nullum habet, ac si
nunquam fuisset genitus, successorem.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">The father surviving, the dead
<i>filiusfamilias</i> has no successor,
as if he had never been born.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>This seems to make it clear that, the grandfather
being alive, the grandchildren took by right under
ancient custom no share in their deceased father’s
property. It was simply merged in the family
holding, and they must wait for their shares in it
along with the other co-sharers after the grandfather’s
death.</p>

<p>The growing feeling of the injustice of this from
the individual point of view was probably the reason,
not only why the permission in Chapter XVI. was
given, but also why, following the example of Roman
law, the emancipation of sons was admitted.</p>

<p>Chapter XI. proceeds, after the initial sentence
above quoted, to tell what happened in the case of
the death of an emancipated son dying without
children. But this does not concern us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Both in
Norse and
Scanian
custom
originally
on a son’s
death his
share in
the odal
merged
in the
common
stock.</div>

<p>It may be well before passing from the consideration
of these clauses of the Scanian law to bring into
notice a short isolated clause from the Gulathing
law, which seems to accord with them, and so to
connect the Scanian rules of family holdings with
somewhat similar rules as to the Norse odal-sharing.
The denial of the right of representation in both
Scanian and Norse ancient custom suggests that a
common principle may underlie the custom in both
cases.</p>

<p>The clause of the Gulathing law (294) is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Nu ero brœðr tveir oc andast
annar fyrr en faðer þeirra oc livir
sunr efter hinn dauða. Þa scal
hann þann lut leysa oðrla at
fimtungs falla, undan faður brœðr
sinum, sem faður hans stoð til
efter faður sinn. En eigi ma hann
fyrr leysa en faður faðer hans er
andaðr.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Now there are two brothers
and one of them dies before their
father, and a son lives after his
death. He shall redeem from his
father’s brother, at one fifth less,
that part of the odal to which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
father was expectant heir after his
father. But he may not redeem
it till his father’s father be dead.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>In this case, as before, there are living a grandfather
and a son and a grandson (son of a deceased
son). The share which the deceased son as coheir
with his brother might at first sight be expected to
take in the grandfather’s odal does not go directly to
the grandson. By apparently a new law he has
permission after the grandfather’s death to redeem it
from his uncle at one fifth less than its value.</p>

<p>This can only be explained upon the principle
that under ancient Norse custom the sons of a
deceased son would not succeed by right of representation
to their deceased father’s share in the division
of the grandfather’s property. Evidently the right
to redeem it from their uncle was an innovation of
later law.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The new
rules to
amend
tribal
custom
show what
it once
was. Thus the
Scanian
laws throw
light on
Norse odal
holdings.
They were
family
holdings.</div>

<p>These and other innovations may have been the
result of a new sense of justice brought in with
Christianity or under the influence of Roman law. The
question for us is the meaning of the ancient custom.
And we are brought back to the point that in so far
as the family group more or less may have resembled
the Cymric gwely, and is approached from this point of
view, it must be regarded as the group of descendants
of a common grandfather or great-grandfather, who
is, in the Archbishop’s phrase, the <i>paterfamilias</i>.
While he is alive the landed rights are vested in him.
On his death his sons take his place with divided or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
undivided equal shares, but still as the representative
members of the original gwely or family group. One
of them dies, and the question is whether the surviving
brothers ‘of the prior grade’ are to promote into
this grade at once the sons of their deceased brother.
Such a course might naturally be regarded as preferring
these nephews to their own sons. The rights
of all the members of the ‘lower grade’ will come in
time when all of the ‘prior grade’ are gone and the
grandsons share equally <i>per capita</i> in the family
property. In the meantime the sons of deceased
parents, like those whose fathers are alive, must wait.
So it may have been under ancient custom. But in
course of time family ties weaken and individual
rights grow stronger in national feeling, as we have
seen them everywhere doing. And then little by
little compromises are made. The joint property of
husband and wife, even if not properly ‘defined,’ is
recognised in the Scanian law as belonging to the sons
of the marriage to the very limited extent that they
may have equal shares with the other <i>consortes</i>
whether uncles or cousins. The sons of the deceased
brother when the grandfather is dead and division
among the brothers comes in question are allowed by
the clause in the Gulathing law to buy back their
father’s share in the odal at a fifth less than its
value instead of sharing in it as family property.</p>

<p>So far the clauses in the Scanian and Gulathing
laws considered together seem to throw light upon the
traditional principle on which the rights of the odal-sharers
of the Norse laws may have been founded.</p>

<p>The rules of Cymric custom may not be identical
with those of Scandinavian custom, but we seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
recognise very similar tribal principles at the root of
them both.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The <i>paterfamilias</i>
and those
in communion

<p>Finally other clauses in the Scanian law may be
alluded to as pointing to the common liability of the
family group, <i>i.e.</i> of the <i>paterfamilias</i> and others ‘<i>in
communione</i>’ with him.</p>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Universos contingit de communi
consortio quicquid vel culpa
amittitur vel industria conquiritur
singulorum.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">As regards the common consortium
whatever is lost by the fault
of or acquired by the industry of
individuals concerns all.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>And in Chapter LXXXVII. it is enacted that if
a person denies that he is in possession of a thing
stolen and if afterwards upon scrutiny it is found in
his house, double the value of the thing stolen is to
be taken, ‘not only from the portion of the <i>paterfamilias</i>,
but also from the common property (<i>de bonis
communibus</i>), however many there may be with the
<i>paterfamilias in communione</i>.’</p>

<p>And the reason stated confirms the prevalence of
family holdings of the kind already mentioned.</p>

<p>The double value is to be taken,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">… non de sola patrisfamilias
porcione sed de bonis communibus
quotcunque fuerint cum
patrefamilias in communione.
Nam cum omnes lucrum respicerent
in detentione non est
mirum, si dampnum in ejusdem
rei contingat omnibus restitutione.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">… not from the portion of
the paterfamilias alone, but from
the common property, however
many there may be with the
<i>paterfamilias in communione</i>.
For since all expect gain from the
detention [of the thing stolen] it
is not strange if all sustain loss in
its restitution.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The <i>paterfamilias</i> in whose house the stolen
property is found is evidently himself a member of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
wider family group with common interests and
liabilities. And the clause goes on to say that the
accused must deny the charge with twelve co-swearers
if the thing stolen be worth half a mark,
or submit to the test of the ordeal of hot iron.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The resort
to the
ordeal if
no co-swearers.</div>

<p>In Chapter XCIX. the ordeal of hot iron is
described as having three forms: (1) that of walking
on twelve red-hot plough-shares; (2) that called ‘trux
iarn,’ applied to cases of theft: <i>i.e.</i> carrying an iron
twelve feet and then throwing it into a basin; (3) that
of carrying it nine paces and then casting it down:
called, from the throwing, <i>scuzs iarn</i>. After the
ordeal the feet or hands, as the case might be, were
to be wrapped in cloth and sealed to prevent fraud,
and so to remain till the sabbath, on which day it
should be opened and viewed in order to ascertain
the innocence or guilt of the accused.</p>

<p>This is one of the clauses which fixes the date of
the Latin version, for the ordeal was abolished in
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1215.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, we may fairly conclude that the
Scanian law when regarded from a tribal point of
view affords additional evidence of family occupation
or ownership and of the solidarity of the family
group in Scandinavian society. But at the same time
it shows that in Scandinavia, as elsewhere, family
ownership was gradually succumbing to the new
rules of individual ownership.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same process of gradual disintegration of
tribal usage is visible also in the chapters relating to
wergelds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Scanian
wergeld.</div>

<p>In Chapter XLIII. it is enacted that the amount
to be paid for homicide is not to exceed 15 marks of
silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How
it was
divided.</div>

<p>In Chapter XLIV. it is stated that the wergeld is
to be divided into three equal parts, of which each is
commonly called a <i>sal</i>. And in the next chapter, ‘De
Compositione,’ we are told that before the time of the
last constitution it always lay upon the slayer or his
heir to provide the first portion only from his own
property. He might then exact the second portion
from his agnates, and finally the third and last from
his cognates. Then it proceeds to say that, as excessive
amounts were levied by violence upon the
kindred, King Canute had laid down certain rules for
the payments. <i>Inter alia</i>, it was enacted that of the
two thirds falling on the kindred, both agnates and
cognates being computed in their grades of kinship,
the prior grade should always pay twice as much as
the grades behind it.</p>

<p>Further, in Chapter XLVII. it is stated that according
to ancient law the distribution should be so made
that each third should be divided again into sub-thirds,
one of which should be paid to the heirs of the
slain, the second to the agnates, and the third to
the cognates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later
modifications.</div>

<p>It appears also from Chapter XLV. of the Latin
version and s. 84 of the Danish version that special
care had been taken to prevent fraud on the part of
the slayer in claiming the aid of his kinsmen. He
was to pay one ‘sal’ of his own payment before
calling upon them for their portion, which was called
the <i>ættæbot</i>. He then was to collect together his
father’s friends and compute with them what each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
was to pay. And when the day for payment came,
not a penny was to be paid into the slayer’s hands
till the hour when he paid it over to the slain man’s
kindred. Then they were safe. The same course
was to be afterwards adopted as regards the payments
of maternal relations.</p>

<p>The Latin version (Chapter XLV.) proceeds to
say that this legislation not having been successful
in extirpating fraud and discouraging murder, King
Waldemar II. (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1202-1241) enacted that the
murderer should be liable for the whole wergeld
(instead of one third). The agnates and cognates
were not to be forced by him to contribute against
their will. Within three days the murderer was
publicly to offer satisfaction or be outlawed, in which
case he would be liable to be put to death by any
one. In case, however, of his flight, his relatives,
agnates and cognates, were individually to offer their
proper share of two thirds of the wergeld or be liable
to the vengeance of the relatives of the slain, so that
the latter should not be deprived of all satisfaction.</p>

<p>These clauses throw some light on ancient custom,
but they are evident signs of the gradual loosening of
the ties of kindred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Payment
for the
servus
and
libertus.</div>

<p>In Chapter L. of the Latin version the payment for
a <i>servus</i> is fixed at three marks, and in Chapter LII.
the payment for a <i>libertus</i> is fixed at half that of the
freeborn man.</p>

<p>It is difficult to judge how far these are to be
taken as the ancient wergelds of Scanian custom, or
whether they had been altered in amount by changes
in the currency or recent legislation.</p>

<p>The wergeld of 15 marks of silver is exactly half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
of that of the normal wergeld of the Norse hauld.
And yet it does not seem likely that it had been
reduced in amount by recent legislation when it is
considered that under the Norse laws, as we have
seen, the tendency seemed to be to add ‘sakauka’ to
the ancient wergelds rather than decrease them.</p>

<p>It may be noted also that in a later addition<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> to
the Danish version it is stated that ‘a man’s bot is
30 good marks and overbot 26 marks and 16 ortugs.’
And also in the ‘City Law’ of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1300 the wergeld
is stated at 30 marks with an additional ‘overbot.’<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The
Scanian
wergeld
perhaps
that of
the
‘bonde.’</div>

<p>We seem bound to consider the wergeld of the
freeborn man under the ‘Lex Scania antiqua’ of
the previous century as 15 marks of silver.</p>

<p>The explanation probably may be that the <i>bonde</i>
and not the hauld was taken as the typical freeborn
man.</p>

<p>When it is further considered that in the Danish
version of the Scanian law there is no mention of the
hauld, and that, as we have seen, the <i>bonde</i> seems to
have been regarded as the ordinary householder or
<i>paterfamilias</i> of the family holding, the inference
becomes probably a fair one that the <i>bonde</i> was the
typical <i>ingenuus</i> or freeborn man for the purpose of
the wergelds.</p>

<p>If this may be assumed, then the wergelds of the
Scanian law accord well with the Norse wergelds.
For in that case the wergeld of the bonde is 15 marks
of silver in both laws. And further the wergeld of
the <i>libertus</i> of the Scanian law and that of the Norse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
leysing after he had made his freedom’s ale also
correspond, being half that of the bonde.</p>

<p>It may further be noted that as in the Norse law
so also in the Scanian law the payment for an eye or
hand or foot was half a manbot, while the full
manbot was payable if both eyes or hands or feet
were destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<h3>VI. SCANIAN AND LOMBARDIC CUSTOM COMPARED.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Lombardic
custom.</div>

<p>Before closing this very imperfect chapter on the
Scandinavian laws it may be well to compare with them
clauses from the Lombardic laws relating to the family
holding of land and property ‘in communione.’</p>

<p>The laws of the tribes still remaining on the Baltic
were five or six centuries later in date than the laws of
the Lombardic emigrants who had left their old home
and settled in the South upon Roman ground. And
yet in this matter we find traces of the same ancient
custom of family holdings underlying them both, notwithstanding
wide separation, and what is more, of the
same process of change going on notwithstanding the
difference in date. Roman and Christian influences
had not reached the Scanian district on the Baltic
till the twelfth century, and were only then effecting
changes which in the seventh century had already
been accomplished in Transylvania and Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edict of
Rothar.
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 643.
Kindred
of seven
generations.</div>

<p>The first clause to which reference may be made
is s. 153 of the ‘Edict of Rothar’ (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 643). It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
entitled ‘De gradibus cognationum.’ It is interesting
as showing that seven generations were necessary to
the complete kindred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Omnis parentilla usque in
septimum geniculum nomeretur,
ut parens parenti per gradum et
parentillam heres succedat: sic
tamen ut ille qui succedere vult,
nominatim unicuique nomina
parentum antecessorum suorum
dicat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Let every parentilla up to the
seventh knee be named, so that
parent to parent by grade and
<i>parentilla</i> the heir may succeed;
so moreover that he who wishes
to succeed must tell name by
name the names of his antecedent
<i>parentes</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Seven generations would reach back to the great-grandfather’s
great-grandfather, an important limit
of kindred both in the Norse laws and those of the
Cymri.</p>

<p>Another clause of the same edict (c. 167), under
the heading ‘<i>De fratres, qui in casam communem
remanserent</i>,’ enacts as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Family
holdings.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si fratres post mortem patris
in casa commune remanserint,
et unus ex ipsis in obsequium
regis aut judicis aliquas res
adquesiverit, habeat sibi in antea
absque portionem fratrum; et
qui foras in exercitum aliquit
adquisiverit, commune sit fratribus
quod in casa dimiserit.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If brothers shall have remained
in the common home
after the father’s death and one
of them shall have acquired
some property in service of the
king or judge, let him henceforth
have it for himself without the
brothers sharing in it. And if
one shall have acquired anything
abroad in the army let that be in
common to the brothers which
he left behind in the home.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Et si quis in suprascriptis
fratribus gairethinx fecerit,
habeat in antea cui factum
fuerit.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">And if any one of the said
brothers makes a donation, let him
to whom it was made have it
henceforth.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The rest of the clause refers to payments to a
wife brought into the family holding by a brother.
The ‘meta’ or portion has, in this case, been given
to her on marriage out of the common property,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and so the rights of the other brothers have to be
considered.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Et qui ex ipsis uxorem
duxerit, et de rebus communes
meta data fuerit: quando alteri
idem uxorem tollere contigerit,
aut quando ad divisionem faciendam
venerit, simili modo de
comunes rebus ei refundatur
aliut tantum quantum frater in
meta dedit. De paterna autem
vel materna substantia quod
relicum fuerit inter se æqualiter
dividant.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">And he who of them marries
a wife and her <i>meta</i> was given
from the common property, whenever
it happens to another likewise
to take a wife or whenever
it comes to a division being made,
in the same way there shall be
refunded to him from the common
property as much as the
brother gave in meta. But
whatever is left of the paternal
or maternal substance let them
divide among them equally.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rules of
family
divisions.</div>

<p>Attempts to settle such questions as these, whether
and how far property acquired by one brother is to form
part of the common family property or be retained
by the brother acquiring it, and again how the fact
that the payment for a wife’s ‘meta’ had been taken
from the common family property was to affect the
rights of the brothers when they came to a division,
are in themselves good proof, so far as they go, of the
continuance of family holdings. But the changes
made by these clauses show the same tendency
which we have seen in the Scanian laws towards
individual ownership and the breaking up of the
family holdings.</p>

<p>Finally, the point which in the Scanian laws
was most suggestive of the original completeness of
the family community of property, viz. that originally
there was no succession of sons to their father’s
share, but division <i>per capita</i> between the uncles
on the grandfather’s death, appears again in the
Lombardic laws and is dealt with in the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
century practically in the same way as in Scania it
was dealt with centuries later.</p>

<p>From the tribal point of view the solidarity of the
family group was the chief interest regarded. But
the point of view was changed. Under the new
influences the interests of the individual came more
and more into prominence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No succession
of
sons by
representation
at
first, but
afterwards
allowed.</div>

<p>It now seemed unjust to the sons that their
father’s property should be allowed simply to lapse
into the common stock of the family till the grandfather’s
death and then left to be divided among the
uncles. And to mitigate the injustice the right to
succeed was given, in the Lombardic as in the
Scanian laws, to the limited extent that upon the
grandfather’s death the sons took the share of their
father with the uncles in the division, as if he had
been living at the time.</p>

<p>S. 5 of the ‘Leges a Grimowaldo additæ’ is headed
‘<i>De successione nepotum qui post mortem patris in
sinu avi remanserint</i>,’ and is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si quis habuerit filios legitimos
unum aut plures, et contigerit
unum ex filiis vivente
patre mori, et reliquerit filios
legitimos, unum aut plures, et
contigerit avo mori, talem partem
percipiat de substantia avi sui,
una cum patruis suis, qualem
pater eorum inter fratribus suis
percepturus erat si vivus fuisset.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If any one shall have legitimate
sons, one or more, and it
happens that one of the sons
dies, the father being living, and
he leaves legitimate sons, one or
more, and it happens that the
grandfather dies, let him [the
son] take such part of the substance
of his grandfather together
with his uncles as their father if
he had been alive would have
taken among his brothers.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Similiter et si filias legitimas
unam aut plures, aut filii naturales
unum aut plures fuerint
habeant legem suam, sicut in
hoc edictum legitur. Quia inhumanum et impium nobis
videtur, ut pro tali causa exhereditentur
filii ab hereditatem patris
sui pro eo, quod pater eorum in
sinu avi mortuos est, sed ex
omnibus ut supra aequalem cum
patruis suis in locum patris post
mortem avi percipiant portionem.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Likewise also if there were
legitimate daughters, one or more,
or natural sons, one or more, let
them have their rights as is
decreed in this edict. Because it
seems to us inhuman and impious
that for such a cause sons should
be disinherited from the inheritance
of their father because their
father died in the mund of their
grandfather. But let them take
an equal portion with their
uncles of everything in the place
of their father.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The continued existence of community in the
family property is shown by the fact that, even after
the concession made in this clause, during the grandfather’s
lifetime everything fell into the common stock
and not till a family redivision was made after the
grandfather’s death was the new rule admitting the
sons’ succession along with their uncles to take
effect.</p>

<p>To trace further the survivals of tribal custom in
the Lombardic laws would lead us too far afield.
The clauses already quoted are sufficient to show a
remarkable similarity of custom in the case of tribes
once neighbours on the Baltic notwithstanding that
they had been widely separated and that there was
an interval of five or six centuries between the dates
of their laws.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>TRIBAL CUSTOM IN SCOTLAND.</i></span></h2>

<h3>I. TRACES OF TRIBAL CUSTOM IN THE LAWS OF THE
EARLY KINGS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Tribal
custom
in the
ancient
laws of
Scotland.</div>

<p>The population of Scotland was so various in origin
and language that it would be unreasonable to expect
uniformity of custom. Even where Celtic custom was
best able to hold its own there must naturally have
been a mixture of Cymric and Gaelic elements. In
districts, on the other hand, where Frisian and
Northumbrian and Danish and Norse influences may
have once predominated, whatever survivals there may
have been of tribal custom from any of these origins
may well have been afterwards submerged under
legal forms and ideas from Anglo-Norman sources.</p>

<p>It is worth while, however, to examine what
scattered survivals of tribal custom may be found in
the laws of the early kings, and in the various documents
collected in the first volume of the ‘Ancient
Laws of Scotland.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That tribal custom as to wergeld existed and was
recognised is proved by the necessity to abolish what
remained of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus in the ‘Leges Quatuor Burgorum’ is the
following clause:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laws of
the Four
Burgs.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>XVII. <i>Of bludewyt and siklyk thingis.</i></p>

<p>And it is to wyt at in burgh sall nocht be herde bludewyt na
yit stokisdynt [styngisdynt] na merchet na heregelde na nane suilk
maner of thyng.</p>

</div>

<p>This wholesale and disdainful disregard of feudal
and tribal customs on the part of the townsmen of
the four Burgs was followed somewhat later by an
Ordinance of Edward I. (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1305) which again testifies
to the wider survival of more directly Celtic
tribal usages by forbidding their continuance.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ordene est que l’usages de Scots et de Brets desorendroit soit
defendu si que mes ne soient usez.</p>

</div>

<p>Here we have the usages of the Brets and Scots
distinctly recognised as still lingering on so late as
the beginning of the fourteenth century in some parts
of Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laws of
King
David.</div>

<p>In the laws of King David<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> there are distinct
traces of ancient custom as regards wergelds and the
connection of the kindred with their payment and
receipt. In section XIV. it is enacted:<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If in any place within the peace of the King any one shall
attempt to strike another, he shall pay to the King 4 cows and to
the other 1 cow. If he shall really strike, but without drawing blood,
6 cows to the King and 2 cows to the other. If blood be drawn,
9 cows to the King and 3 to the person struck. If he slay the
other, he shall give to the King ‘<i>XXIX ky and a colpindach</i>’
(juvenca).<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> And he shall assyth to the kin of him slain after
the assyse of the land.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Clause XV. deals with violence done in the king’s
court:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If any one draws a knife to another in the King’s Court it
shall be stricken through the middle of his hand. If he draws
blood, the hand shall be cut off. And if he slay any man, he shall
give to the King <i>XX ky and a colpindach</i> [ixˣˣ, Ayr MS.] and he
shall make peace with the kin of him slain and with the King
‘after the assyse of the kynrik.’</p>

</div>

<p>In both these clauses the wergeld to the kin is
additional to the payment to the king (of 180 cows?)
for breach of his peace.</p>

<p>Clause XVI. forbids the letting off of a thief for
money or friendship. An earl or any one having the
freedom and custom of an earl who does this is to
pay to the king 100 cows, and other great men not of
earl’s rank 34 cows. The thief is to be ‘outlawed
through all the king’s land.’</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that in the time of King David the
system of wergelds payable to the kindred of the
person slain was generally in force, though no amount
is mentioned, and that payments were made at this
date mostly in cows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assize of
King
William.</div>

<p>In the ‘Assize of King William’ under date <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
1180 is the following mention of the <i>wergeld</i> to be paid
evidently for a thief who has been allowed to escape
as above.</p>

<p>Of every thief through all Scotland whether that he be bondman
or freeman the wergeld is XXXIV ky and a half.</p>

</div>

<p>The following clause is further evidence of the
continued right of vengeance on the part of the kin
of a person slain.</p>

<p>This clause reveals a social division of classes
into thanes, <i>ochtyerns</i>,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and carls or rustics; to which
another clause (IV., <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1230) enables us to add the
nativus or ‘<i>kind-born bondman</i>.’</p>

<p>It is not needful to pursue the inquiry into the
laws of the later kings of Scotland. But among
the ‘Fragmenta’ in App. V. (p. 375) of the collection
there is one which must not be overlooked, although
it may be difficult to fix its date. It seems to be
made up of two fragments united and is interesting
as containing two very different statements of the
payment ‘for the life of a man.’</p>

<p>Put into modern English, the first part is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>All laws either are man’s law or God’s law. By the law of
God, a head for a head, a hand for a hand, an eye for an eye, a foot
for a foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>By the law of man <i>for the life of a man ixˣˣ cows</i>, for a foot
a mark, for a hand as much, for an eye half a mark, for an ear as
much, for a tooth 12 pence, for each inch of length of the wound
12 pence, for each inch of breadth of the wound 12 pence. For a
stroke under the ear 16 pence, for a stroke with a staff 8 pence,
and if he fall with the stroke 16 pence. For a wound in the face he
shall give an image of gold [? a coin with the King’s head upon it].</p>

</div>

<p>The other part is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And by man’s law for breaking of bones 5 ores, for a wound
under the clothes 12 pence. For a wound before the sleeve
16 pence, and for each visible wound except the face 15 pence.
<i>For a man’s life 12 marks</i>; for a wound above the chest 6 solidi,
and under the chest 60 pence; for a foot stroke 60 pence; for blood
drawn 25 shillings, and beyond the sea 6 cows.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Amount
of the
wergeld
doubtful.</div>

<p>Now what are we to make of these ‘Fragmenta’?
Clearly the two fragments must be taken separately,
for in the first the payment ‘for the life of a man’ is
180 cows and in the second the payment ‘for a man’s
life’ is twelve marks.</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson seems to have concluded that the
payment of 180 cows was the wergeld according to
the Assize of Scotland, or, as he puts it, ‘the manbote
for homicide throughout Scotia.’<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> But he arrived at
this conclusion apparently by connecting this fragment
with the clause already quoted in the Assize of
King David which states that a person killing another
in any place within the king’s peace ‘shall pay to
the king 180 cows and a colpindach.’ He concluded
that the payment was 180 cows from the reading
‘ixˣˣ cows,’ as it is found in the Ayr manuscript
of one of the clauses, as already stated. But the
clause itself shows that this payment to the king was
not the wergeld, because after making this payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the slayer had still to ‘assyth to the kin of him slain
after the assyse of the land.’</p>

<p>Nor does it seem any more likely that the payment
of twelve marks mentioned in the second fragment
was the wergeld of Scottish custom. From its
amount it seems much more likely to correspond
with the payment already alluded to as the ‘wergeld’
of the thief allowed to escape, which, however, might
possibly represent that of persons of lowest rank.</p>

<p>The evidence of these undated fragments leaves us
in the dark as to what the wergeld of the ancient
Assize of Scotland may have been. Confused and
mixed statements as to the wergelds are not surprising
when the mixture of races is taken into account, and,
after all, the phrase ‘after the assize of the land’ or
‘after the assize of the Kynrik’ may refer only to
those portions of the kingdom to which the laws of
King David specially applied.</p>

<h3>II. THE ‘REGIAM MAJESTATEM.’</h3>

<p>Further traces of tribal custom are mentioned in
the treatise entitled ‘Regiam majestatem’<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> apart from
the remarkable addition to it, which also appears
again as a separate document, under the heading
‘Leges inter Brettos et Scotos.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scotch
version of
Glanville.</div>

<p>The ‘Regiam Majestatem’ itself may be regarded
as a version of Glanville’s well-known treatise on
English law, applied with alterations and adaptations
to Scotland by a Scotch writer conversant with local
custom, and probably dating between <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1200 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
1230.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>As in the laws of King David and his successors,
so in the body of this treatise, references to ancient
usages occur with occasional survivals of untranslated
Gaelic words which seem to refer them back to Celtic
tribal custom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Celtic
survivals
here and
there.</div>

<p>Thus, in Lib. II. s. ix, in reference to the modes
by which <i>nativi</i> might obtain freedom, a specially
Scotch addition is made, to the effect that if a lord has
carnal intercourse with the betrothed wife of his
<i>servus</i>, and this is proved by the visinage, the
<i>servus</i> is thereupon released from the servitude of
his lord; and then follows the phrase ‘nec aliud
<i>enache</i> habebit a domino suo nisi recuperationem
libertatis.’ This untranslated Gaelic word <i>enache</i>
has already been met with in the <i>enec-lann</i> of the
Irish ‘honour-price,’ and we shall find it used again
when we come to the customs of the Bretts and Scots.</p>

<p>So, in Lib. IV. c. 7, in cases of rape the woman
(according to the text of Glanville) is to make it
known to men in good position (<i>probi homines</i>) or to
the ‘<i>prepositus</i> of the hundred.’ In this Scotch
treatise the writer inserts instead of the words ‘<i>prepositus</i>
of the hundred’ ‘<i>vicecomitatus vel le toshederach</i>.’
The Gaelic <i>Toshach</i> or chieftain of a district
is much in evidence in the marginal records of the
‘Book of Deer.’<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, in IV. 12, in a passage not found in
Glanville, the theft of a calf or ram or whatever can
be carried off on the back is described in the local
words ‘<i>berthinsak</i> seu <i>yburthananseca</i>.’</p>

<p>In the same chapter is inserted the already
quoted clause from the Assize of King William as to
the wergeld of a thief who has been allowed to
escape.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>De unoquoque fure per totam Scociam est <i>wargeld</i> triginta
vacce et una juvenca sive fuerit liber sive servus.</p>

</div>

<p>In IV. xxiii. a pledge is mentioned ‘quod vocatur
<i>culrach</i>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cro and
galnes of
person
killed paid
to the
<i>parentes</i>.</div>

<p>In IV. xxx. of the treatise it is stated that if a
person on horseback rides over some one going before
him so as to kill him, he must render for the dead
man so killed ‘<i>cro et galnes</i>’ as if he killed him with
his own hands; and it goes on to say that if the rider
treads a man to death by riding over him when <i>backing</i>
his horse (as it would not then presumably be his
fault) he is to pay nothing but ‘the fourth foot of the
horse,’ which satisfaction the <i>parentes</i> of the man killed
ought to accept.</p>

<p>The mention in this treatise of <i>cro and galnes</i> payable
to <i>parentes</i> of the slain seems to imply that the
customs relating to payments for homicide were
generally in force throughout Scotland and not confined
to any particular district. The words ‘cro and
galnes,’ apparently meaning the wergeld, meet us
again in the document relating to the customs of the
Bretts and Scots.</p>

<p>The final clause (IV. liv.) describes the ‘merchet’
of women ‘according to the assize of Scotland.’ It
begins by stating that the merchet of a woman,
<i>quecunque mulier fuerit, sive nobilis, sive serva, sive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
mercenaria</i>, is ‘una juvenca vel tres solidi’ with 3<i>d.</i>
as <i>rectum servientis</i>. Surely a female slave is here
intended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merchet
of several
grades
of women.</div>

<p>This seems to be the minimum ‘merchet,’ for the
clause proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And if she be the daughter of a freeman and not of the lord of
the town (<i>dominus ville</i>) her merchet shall be one cow or six
shillings and ‘rectum servientis’ 6<i>d.</i> Likewise the merchet [of the
daughter] of a thane’s son or <i>ochethiern</i> two cows or twelve shillings
and ‘rectum servientis’ 12<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Likewise the merchet of the daughter of an earl (<i>comes</i>); and
that of a queen; twelve cows and ‘rectum servientis’ two solidi.</p>

</div>

<p>This clause regarding the ‘merchet’ is useful
as giving a scale of values in cows and shillings.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>juvenca = 3 shillings. cow = 6 shillings.</p>

<p>And the merchet scale:</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Value
the cow
six Norman
shillings:
at 1:12
= stater.</div>

<p>The solidus of this document can hardly be any
other than the Anglo-Norman silver shilling of 12
pence of 32 wheat-grains, <i>i.e.</i> 384 w.g. The cow
equalled six of these shillings or 2304 w.g. At the
Anglo-Norman ratio of 1:12 the value of the cow
would thus be 192 wheat-grains: that is, exactly the
normal ox-unit of two gold solidi of Imperial
standard.</p>

<p>This curious result is not only interesting as one
more instance of the tenacity of custom in retaining
the traditional gold value of the animal used as the
unit of payments when made in cattle, but also useful
for our present purpose as affording a valuable proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
that the Scotch compiler of the ‘Regiam Majestatem’
in appending the important clauses relating to the
customs of the Bretts and Scots which follow closely
upon this merchet clause was adding to his work a
quite independent document, probably of much earlier
date.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
the cow
in the
next
document
three ores,
or at 1:8
= stater.</div>

<p>In this added document while the payments are
again stated in cows, the value of the cow is reckoned,
not in shillings, but in <i>ores</i>, which the figures, when
examined, show to be ores of 16 pence. This reckoning
in ores of 16 pence suggests a Norse or Danish
influence. For, although the Anglo-Norman reckoning
in shillings of 12 pence ultimately conquered and
became the prevalent reckoning in the Scotch
statutes, there was no doubt a period when the
reckoning in ores of 16 pence was in use in Danish
England, probably including Northumbria.</p>

<p>This is shown by a law, probably of Cnut’s,<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
which enacted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Et ipsi qui portus custodiunt
efficiant per overhirnessam meam
ut omne pondus sit marcatum ad
pondus quo pecunia mea recipitur,

<p class="lang2of2">Those who have charge of the
towns (<i>portus</i>) shall secure that
under penalties every weight shall
be marked at the weight by which
my money is received, and let
each of them be marked so that
fifteen ores shall make a pound.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The ores of this law, as we shall see, were evidently
ores of 16 pence, or 512 wheat-grains (16 × 32),
for fifteen of such ores made the Saxon and Anglo-Norman
pound of 240 pence, or 7680 wheat-grains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danish
ratio of
1:8.</div>

<p>The fact that the ore of the document describing
the customs of the Bretts and Scots was the same
ore as that in use with both Danes and English in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Danish England and probably Northumbria about
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1000 is an important one. For in this document
the value of the cow of the Bretts and Scots is stated
to be three ores, <i>i.e.</i> 1536 wheat-grains of silver, and
at the Scandinavian ratio of 1:8 the gold value of
the cow would therefore be once more 192 wheat-grains
or two gold solidi of Imperial standard. That
the Danish ratio was 1:8 as in the Scandinavian laws
we shall find to be involved in the Anglo-Danish
compacts making Danes and English ‘equally dear,’
while as late as <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1192 the Abbey of Kelso compounded
for payments to the Pope at the same ratio,
two solidi of sterlings (24<i>d.</i> of 32 wheat-grains), or
768 wheat-grains of silver being paid for the gold
solidus of 96 wheat-grains.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Laws

<p>We may therefore consider that the document
relating to the Bretts and Scots belongs to the period
of Danish influence, and is of much earlier date than
the work to which it was appended by the Scotch
editor of Glanville.</p>

<p>The remarkable document printed separately in
Appendix III. of the ‘Ancient Laws of Scotland’
under the above title is given in three languages&mdash;Latin,
Norman French, and Scottish English.</p>

<p>The oldest version of it is that of the ‘Berne
Manuscript,’ now in the ‘Register House’ at Edinburgh,
which is considered to be of the thirteenth
century. It appears in this manuscript as a separate
document in Norman French, and therefore it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
seem that we owe this statement of ancient custom to
a Norman scribe. The Latin version added to the

manuscript is of the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thane’s
wergeld
100 cows.</div>

<p>The cro and galnes seem to be substantially the
same thing as the wergeld. The word ‘cro’ is of
uncertain meaning. The ‘cro’ of the Brehon laws is
translated ‘property.’ It seems also to have had the
meaning of ‘death.’ The word ‘galnes’ can hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
be other than the Welsh <i>galanas</i> or wergeld.
Whether the phrase ‘cro and galnes’ means two
things or one thing, and if two things, what the
distinction between them was, it is not easy to see.
But evidently the two together made a single payment
for each grade of rank. The payments, moreover,
are expressed in cows as well as in ores and pence,
and the payment of 100 cows seems to mark the <i>thane</i>
as the typical and complete tribesman.</p>

<p>The two explanatory clauses introduce a third
element, the ‘enach.’</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Cro of a woman having a husband is one third less than
the husband’s cro, and if no husband she has the same cro as her
brother.</p>

<p>The <i>Cro</i> and the <i>galnys</i> and the <i>enach</i> of every man are alike,
that is to say in respect of the <i>enach</i> of their wives [<i>i.e.</i> one third
less than the husband’s].</p>

</div>

<p>The enach, as already said, seems to be the
honour-price of the Brehon law. We have seen that,
according to the Scotch addition and Glanville’s
clause, if a slave was injured by his master, he was
to be set free and his freedom was to be in the place
of any other ‘enach.’ This accords well with the Irish
enec-lann and the Welsh saraad and the Norse rett,
all of which referred to insult rather than bodily
injury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Payments
for breach
of peace
of various
persons.</div>

<p>The next clause relates to homicide ‘in pace regis’
or of other lords. We have already seen that in the
laws of King David the manbote or payment to the
king for breach of his peace, or for crime committed
in his <i>grith</i> or precinct, was a thing distinct from the
satisfaction to be made to the kin of the person
slain ‘according to the assize of the Kynrik.’ In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
these early laws the payment for slaying a man in
the king’s peace was, according to the corrected text,
180 cows. In the following clauses 180 cows are
again the payment for breach of the king’s peace,
but there are payments also for breach of the
peace of other classes.</p>

<p>The next two clauses, under the heading ‘Kelchin’
or ‘Gelchach,’ seem to refer to insult or wounding,
(the Welsh <i>gweli</i> = wound). And as the word <i>enach</i>
does not occur again in the laws of Bretts and Scots
it seems probable that it may have been included
under this heading, and that the Kelchin or Gelchach,
like the Irish <i>enach</i> and the Welsh <i>saraad</i>, referred

<p>That we are right in supposing the kelchin to be
analogous to the Welsh <i>saraad</i> seems to be confirmed
by the interesting additional information appended
to the clauses.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And if the wife of a freeman is slain her husband has the
Kelchyn and her kin the Cro and galnes.</p>

<p>Item if the woman of a carl be slain, the lord of the fee where
he dwells shall have the Kelchin and the vilein shall have his
wife’s <i>turhochret</i> of the Kelchin and her kin shall have the cro
and the galnes.</p>

<p>If a man be killed in the host, his lord shall have the Kelchin
and his <i>parentes</i> the cro and the galnes and the King eight cows
<i>flatha</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>These clauses of explanation are very important
when we try to understand the laws to which they
are appended as a whole.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The
thane’s
wergeld
the normal
one of
100 cows.</div>

<p>Commencing with what seems to be the wergeld,
the ‘cro and galnes’ of the thane, who may be taken as
the typical freeman, was 100 cows. We have seen that
the value of the cow was three ores of silver or, at a
ratio of one to eight, 192 wheat-grains of gold. The
wergeld was therefore, not only the usual round
number of 100 cows, but also in gold value, like that
of the Cymric codes and so many others, exactly
19,200 wheat grains or 200 gold solidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>If we try to trace the connection of this wergeld
with those of other tribes, the coincidence with the
normal wergeld does not help us much.</p>

<p>It is the same as the Welsh galanas of the uchelwr,
and the use in the laws of Cymric and Gaelic words
might lead us to look upon the wergeld as a Celtic one.
But the equality in the payment is in <i>gold</i> and not
in the number of cows. The cro of the thane was
100 cows. The galanas of the Welsh uchelwr was 120
cows. Moreover, the cows in which the Welsh galanas
was paid were equated with three scores of silver, <i>i.e.</i>
three Saxon ounces of 20<i>d.</i>, while the cows in which
the cro was paid were equated with three ores of
16<i>d.</i> And this seems to point to a Danish connection.</p>

<p>All these things taken together seem to point to
a mixture and confusion of influences rather than to
a single origin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The gradations of rank and position disclosed by
the amount of the cro or wergeld seem to be based
upon family seniority, and to have a character of
their own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
gradations
of rank
in the
family.</div>

<p>The King of course stands at the head of the list
with a cro of 1000 cows. His son takes equal rank
with the earl with a cro of 140 cows. The earl’s son
is of equal rank with the thane, and they have a cro
of 100 cows. Then comes the thane’s son with a cro
of one third less, or 66⅔ cows, and next the thane’s
grandson with a cro one third less again, of 44 cows
and 21⅔ pence. All below this in <i>parentela</i> or kin are
classed with rustics or carls, with a cro of 16 cows.</p>

<p>Looking at the position of persons at any given
moment, from the point of view of the thane, he
has the earl and the king above him and the earl’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
son as his equal in rank. Their children and
grandchildren belong still to the chieftain class, but
they are juniors or cadets of the class. Even the
grandchildren of the thane are <i>ogthierns</i>, or young
thanes. In natural course they may presumably take
their father’s rank on his death, but not until that
happens. And possibly only the eldest son of the
earl or of the thane succeeded to the official position
of chieftain of his house.</p>

<p>Beyond this there is not much more to be gathered
concerning the gradations in social rank. Nor are
we told anything about the division of the amount
among the members of the kindred receiving or
paying the cro as the case might be. We are told
only that the cro and galnes belonged to the kin of
the person slain.</p>

<p>Turning from the cro and galnes to the <i>kelchin</i>:
what are we to make of it?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
kelchin
like the
Welsh
saraad
for insult.</div>

<p>The gradations resemble those of the cro to this
extent, that the kelchin of each grade was one third
less than that of the one above, but the kelchin was
no direct fraction of the cro. The kelchin seems, as
we have said, to be something like the Welsh <i>saraad</i>
for insult or wounding, the Irish <i>enec-lann</i> or honour-price,
and the Norse <i>rett</i> or ‘personal right;’ but
it does not seem to correspond altogether with any
one of them.</p>

<p>All we know is that on the homicide of a person,
whoever he might be, in addition to the cro and galnes,
the kelchin had to be paid. But it was a payment
which, like the Cymric saraad, according to the
interesting explanation given, did not go with the
wergeld proper to the kindred or relations in blood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
When a wife was slain, the husband, who was not a
blood relation or of the kindred of the wife, took the
kelchin, while the wergeld proper&mdash;cro and galnes&mdash;went
to her kindred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Each
grade had
a precinct
and a
fine for
breach
of it.
But not
the carl
or rustic.</div>

<p>Turning to the payment which had to be made
for breach of the peace or protection of the lord, it
was a payment due to the king if the homicide were
perpetrated ‘in pace regis,’ and to a person of each
grade in succession, even to the thane’s grandson, in
case the homicide were committed within his precinct.
Only the carl or rustic received no payment,
as presumably he was living on the land of a lord,
who would, therefore, claim it.</p>

<p>The position of the carl or rustic, or in Norman
French the <i>vilein</i>, is interesting. If his wife was
killed the lord took the kelchin. The homicide was
reckoned as an insult and loss to him. The wergeld
did not go to the husband but to the kindred of the
wife, as in the case of those of higher grade. So that,
so far as this at least, there was recognition of
kindred in the rustic’s position. His ‘cro and galnes’
was just about one sixth of that of the thane and
presumably went to his kin&mdash;as his wife’s cro and
galnes went to her kin.</p>

<p>There is one other point as yet unexplained&mdash;what
was the ‘turhochret’?</p>

<p>It occurs in the clause:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Item if the woman of a carl be slain, the lord of the fee where
he dwells shall have the kelchin <i>and the vilein shall have his wife’s
turhochret</i> of the kelchin and her kyn shall have the cro and the
galnes.</p>

</div>

<p>There are so many Gaelic words in this document
that there can be little doubt that the <i>turhochret</i><a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
is one of them. It seems to have been the part of
the kelchin allowed by the lord to go to the husband
in respect of the insult to his wife&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> <i>her</i>
share in the kelchin. Whatever it was, when the
wife was slain, the husband retained it, while the
lord took the rest of the kelchin, and the wife’s kin
the cro and galnes of their slain kinswoman. The
information given is scanty, but it is difficult to make
this passage mean anything else.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The wife
belonged
to her
own
kindred.</div>

<p>One thing is made remarkably clear in this
document: that the wife of the free tribesman did
not among the Bretts and Scots pass upon marriage
under the full <i>potestas</i> of her husband. On her
murder, while it was an insult to him and he therefore
could claim the kelchin, the cro and the galnes
passed to her kin. The wife, therefore, in a very
real sense belonged still to her own kindred.</p>

<p>These rules of tribal custom as regards marriage
need no longer surprise us after what we have found
elsewhere. They closely resemble in principle
Cymric usage and are, after all, what the study of
Beowulf prepared us to regard as by no means confined
to the Celtic tribes.</p>

<h3>IV. RECOGNITION OF THE FOURTH AND NINTH DEGREES
OF KINDRED IN SCOTLAND.</h3>

<p>In the foregoing sections no distinct reference has
been made to the recognition of the fourth and ninth
degrees of kindred. It would be misleading to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
from the Scottish evidence without allusion to the
subject.</p>

<p>Strongly influenced as custom in Scotland must
have been by both Cymric and Gaelic as well as Norse
and Danish traditions, it would be strange if no trace
were left in Scotland of so marked a feature of tribal
policy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nine
degrees of
kindred.</div>

<p>It will be enough, however, to refer the reader to
the interesting chapter on ‘The Kin’ in the second
volume of Mr. Robertson’s ‘Scotland under her early
Kings,’ in which he alludes to ‘the words in which
the Northern St. Margaret is supposed to have
formally renounced her kindred (“al my Kun I forsake
to the nithe Kne”), and to the “nine degrees of
kindred” within which all connected with the Earl
of Fife might claim the privileges of the Clan Mac
Duff.</p>

<p>And after what we have seen of the way in which
the Norse <i>leysing</i> rose by steps of four generations into
increasing freedom as a kindred grew up around him,
it may be worth while to recall attention once more
to the reverse process by which the <i>nativus</i> or <i>villanus</i>
under later law became attached to the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fourth
generation
fixes the
status of
<i>nativi</i>.</div>

<p>Among the fragments of Scotch laws collected
under the heading ‘Quoniam attachiamenta’<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> is the
clause ‘<i>De brevi de nativis</i>’ which may be translated
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There are different kinds of <i>nativi</i> or bondmen. For some are
<i>nativi de avo et proavo</i> which is vulgarly called <i>de evo et trevo</i>,
whom he [the lord] will claim to be his <i>nativi</i> naturally, by beginning
to narrate their ancestors, if their names are known, to
wit, of his <i>great-grandfather</i>, <i>grandfather</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>, and <i>father</i>, who are
convicted by his saying that they all are his <i>nativi</i> in such and
such a villa of his, and in a certain place within the said villa on
servile land, and that they rendered and did to him and his
ancestors servile service for many days and years, and this
“nativitas,” or bondage, can be proved through the parents of the
convicted one, if they are alive, or <i>per bonam assisam</i>.</p>

<p>Likewise, there is another kind of bondage, similar to this,
where some stranger shall have taken some servile land from some
lord doing servile service for the same land, and if he die on the
same land, and his son likewise, and afterwards <i>his</i> son shall have
lived and died on the same land, then all his posterity [<i>i.e.</i> his
great-grandsons] shall be at the fourth grade altogether in servile
condition to his lord, and his whole posterity can be proved in the
same way.</p>

<p>There is a third kind of <i>nativitas</i>, or bondage, where some
freeman, <i>pro dominio habendo vel manutenencia</i> [<i>i.e.</i> for protection
or maintenance] from some magnate, gives himself up to that
lord as his <i>nativus</i> or <i>bondman</i> in his court by the front hair of
his head (<i>per crines anteriores capitis sui</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>Whatever may have been the date and origin of
these remarkable clauses, they are valuable as showing
how tribal tradition became hardened in course
of time into Feudal law, and how, the transition from
tribal to Feudal principles having been accomplished,
what is known everywhere by the name of ‘serfdom,’
became domiciled in Scotland.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>ANGLO-SAXON CUSTOM FROM THE NORMAN POINT
OF VIEW.</i></span></h2>

<h3>I. ANGLO-SAXON CUSTOM AS APPLIED TO NORMANS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kentish
laws to be
treated
apart.</div>

<p>In approaching the question of Anglo-Saxon tribal
custom it is needful to make a clear distinction
between the laws of the Kentish kings and the other
Anglo-Saxon laws.</p>

<p>The laws of the Kentish kings are known only in
the MS.&mdash;the Textus Roffensis&mdash;compiled or collected
by Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester from 1115 to
1125, and are not included in the other collections
containing the laws of King Alfred and Ine.</p>

<p>The evidence for Kentish custom seems, therefore,
to be independent of that of Wessex or Mercia or
Northumbria. Further, in the so-called ‘Laws of
Henry I.’ at the conclusion of the statement of the
customs as to homicide in s. LXXVI. it is distinctly
stated that the wergelds in Kent differed much from
those of Wessex both as regards <i>villani</i> and <i>barones</i>.</p>

<p>It will therefore be necessary to examine the
Kentish laws separately from the others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laws of
Henry I.</div>

<p>On the whole, with regard to the others, it seems
best to resort to the method of proceeding from the
later to the earlier evidence and to begin with the
so-called ‘Laws of Henry I.,’ as a Norman though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
unofficial view of what Anglo-Saxon custom was or
had been before the Conquest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When a
Norman
was killed.</div>

<p>It may be well to inquire first, what in the view
of the writer took place, after the Conquest, when a
Norman or stranger was killed, because this at once
raises the question what should happen in the unavoidable
absence of kindred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si Francigena qui parentes non
habeat in murdro perimatur,

<p class="lang2of2">(lxxv. 6) If a Norman (<i>Francigena</i>)
be murdered who has no
<i>parentes</i>, let that person have the

where he was found unless within
7 days the malefactor be delivered
up to the justice of the King in
such a way that justice can be had
of him.…</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Ad patrem vero, non ad
matrem, generacionis consideracio

penitus alium non habeat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(7) Consideration as to birth
must be directed to the father, not
to the mother, for the King ought
to be in the place of maternal
kindred (<i>cognatio</i>) and of advocate

absolutely have no other.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si ex parte patris parentes non

<p class="lang2of2">(8) If he who is killed has no

he has on his mother’s side, let
what appertains to her, viz. one-third

</div>

</div>

<p>These clauses show that when a Norman or
stranger was slain, in a certain way the king was to
stand in the place of the absent kindred to see that
justice was done.</p>

<p>The maternal kindred of the slain, if such were at
hand, should receive the third of the wergeld which
pertained to them, and so presumably the paternal
kindred, if they alone were present, should take the
two thirds pertaining to them, the king taking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
share of the maternal kindred. In any case the right
of the <i>parentes</i> was recognised when they were present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When the
slayer was
a Norman.</div>

<p>Next with regard to the payment of the wergeld
in the case of the slayer being a Norman or a
stranger:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si quis hujusmodi faciat homicidium,

<p class="lang2of2">(9) If he [the slayer] have

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang2of2">(10) If any one who has no

<p class="lang2of2">If any such person is killed,
then <i>according to ancient law</i>, if
he have no kindred half shall be
paid to the King and half to the
<i>congildones</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Recurrence
to
Anglo-Saxon
custom.</div>

<p>These clauses are valuable as showing that to
meet the circumstances arising upon the Norman
Conquest there was a recurrence as far as possible to
ancient law and Anglo-Saxon custom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protection
of the
kinless
stranger.</div>

<p>This was not the first time that the difficulty of
absence of kindred had occurred and been formally
recognised in England. The early Danish conquests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
had made special provisions necessary for the protection
of the kinless stranger. And it was declared
that ‘if any one did wrong to an ecclesiastic or a
foreigner as to money or as to life, then should the
king or the eorl there in the land and the bishop of
the people be unto him in the place of a kinsman and
of a protector (for <i>moeg</i> and for <i>mund-boran</i>) unless
he had another.’<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Again, as regards the position of the maternal
relations and the <i>congildones</i> of a stranger, it is clear
that the writer of these so-called laws is copying and
adopting what he finds in the Laws of King Alfred.
In ss. 27 and 28 of the latter, in the absence of
relatives the <i>gegildas</i> of the slayer were to pay half
the wergeld; and also, in the absence of relatives of
the slain person, his <i>gegildas</i> were to receive half
the wergeld.</p>

<p>In both cases an artificial group of organised
comrades, ‘gegildas’ or ‘congildones,’ seems to have
been recognised as in part taking the place of kindred.
And the importance of the provision of some such
substitute for protection by the oaths of kinsmen is
evident enough when it is considered that the ordeal
of hot iron or water was the recognised alternative.</p>

<p>On the whole the clauses in these so-called laws
relating to Normans and strangers adhere to the
principle of the liability of kindred both paternal and
maternal in cases of homicide, and this is the more remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
because long before, especially in the Laws
of Edmund, as will hereafter appear, a very strong
tendency had been shown to restrict the liability in
case of homicide to the slayer himself.</p>

<p>In the meantime the attempt to apply the Anglo-Saxon
custom as to wergelds to Normans after the
Conquest, taken together with the continued recognition
of the liability of both paternal and maternal
<i>parentes</i>, is a very strong proof that the solidarity of
the kindred was not altogether a thing of the past.
Tribal custom which at the Norman Conquest could
be applied to the conquering class cannot be regarded
as dead.</p>

<h3>II. NORMAN VIEW OF WESSEX CUSTOM.</h3>

<p>We pass on now to clause LXX. of the ‘Laws of
Henry I.’ with the heading ‘Consuetudo Westsexe.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wessex
wergeld of
twyhynde
or villanus
and
twelve-hynde
or
thane.</div>

<p>The amount of the wergeld according to Wessex
law is thus stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">In Westsexa, que caput regni
est et legum, twihindi, i. villani
wera est iiii lib.; twelfhindi, i.
thaini xxv lib.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(lxx. i) In Wessex, which is
the capital of the kingdom and of
laws, the wer of the twyhyndeman,
<i>i.e.</i> of the villanus, is four
pounds; of the twelvehyndeman,
<i>i.e.</i> of the thane, twenty-five
pounds.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon and Norman lb. of silver was
240<i>d.</i>, and thus the twelve-hyndeman’s wergeld of
25 lbs. was the same thing as the ancient Wessex
wergeld of 1200 Wessex scillings of 5<i>d.</i> Four
pounds was a rough equivalent of the twyhyndeman’s
wergeld of 200 Wessex scillings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>A little further on in the same clause is the
following quotation from Ethelred II.’s compact with
Olaf.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si Anglicus homo Dacum occidat,
liber liberum, persolvat eum
xxv lib. vel ipse malefactor reddatur,
et tantundem reddat Dacus
de Anglico si eum occidat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(lxx. s. 6.) If an Englishman
kill a Dane&mdash;a freeman a freeman&mdash;let
him pay for him 25 lbs. or
the criminal himself shall be delivered
up. And let the Dane do
the same if he kill an Englishman.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The English and Danish typical freeman of this
clause with his 25 lb. wergeld is clearly recognised
in these so-called laws as the twelve-hyndeman and
not the twyhynde man, who, though free, is identified
with the ‘villanus.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wife still
belongs to
her own
kindred in
respect of
wergeld.</div>

<p>In further sections of this clause regarding
Wessex customs very important statements are made
with regard to the position of the wife in case of
homicide, showing (1) that if she committed homicide
her own kindred were responsible for her crime and
not her husband or his kindred; and (2) that in case
of the murder of a wife the wergeld went to <i>her</i>
kindred and not to the husband or his kindred.
In s. 12 of this clause is the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Similiter, si mulier homicidium
faciat, in eam vel in progeniem
vel parentes ejus vindicetur,
vel inde componat: non in
virum suum, seu clientelam innocentem.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">Likewise if a woman commits
homicide let it be avenged on her
or on her children or <i>parentes</i> or
paid for from that side, not on
her husband, or innocent connections.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>And in s. 13:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si mulier occidatur, sicut
weregildum ejus est reddatur, ex
parte patris, sicut observamus in
aliis. (14) Si pregnans occidatur
et puer in ea vivat, uterque plena
wera reddatur. Si nondum vivus
sit, dimidia wera solvatur parentibus
ex parte patris.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If a woman be killed, whatever
be her wergeld, let it be paid
<i>ex parte patris</i> just as we have
said in other cases. (14) If a
pregnant woman be killed and her
child be living let the full wergeld
of both be paid. If not yet living
let half a wergeld be paid [for it]
to the <i>parentes ex parte patris</i>,
[of the child].</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The position of the wife under Wessex custom is
further shown by the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si sponsa virum suum supervixerit,
dotem et maritacionem
suam, cartarum instrumentis vel
testium exhibicionibus ei traditam,
perpetualiter habeat, et morgangivam
suam et terciam partem de
omni collaboracione sua, preter
vestes et lectum suum; et si quid
ex eis in elemosinis vel communi
necessitate consumpserit, nichil
inde recipiat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(ss. 22-23). If the wife survive
her husband let her have permanently
her dower and her
‘maritagium’ given to her by
written instruments or production
of witnesses, and her ‘morgengift’
and a third part of all joint
acquisition, besides clothes and
her bed, and let her receive nothing
in respect of what has been
consumed in charity or common
necessity.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Si mulier absque liberis
moriatur, parentes ejus cum
marito suo partem suam dividant.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If a woman die without children
her <i>parentes</i> divide her share
with the husband.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>These statements are valuable evidence that, in
regard to the position of a wife, Anglo-Saxon custom
was very nearly the same as Cymric custom and that
of the Bretts and Scots. And they are the more
important as stating in black and white what is only
to be inferred from isolated statements in earlier
laws.</p>

<p>We now pass to c. LXXVI., <i>De precio cujuslibet</i>,
containing information as to the mode of procedure
in the payment of wergeld.</p>

<p>After stating that if a man be slain he is to be
paid for according to his birth, the clause proceeds
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sureties

<p class="lang2of2">And it is right that the homicide

8 <i>exparte patris</i> and 4 <i>de

shall be raised among them the
peace of the king in every wergeld.
And first the <i>halsfang</i> should
be paid according to the nature of

</div>

</div>

<p>Following the case of the twelve-hyndeman a little
further we learn that:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is evidently here an error. ‘V marc’

<p>Thus we learn that in the case of the twy-hyndeman
the halsfang of 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and the frumgeld of 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
make up the first 20<i>s.</i> of the wergeld of four pounds.

custom. There is, however, great
difference in the wergeld of both
<i>villani</i> and <i>barones</i> in Kent.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Thus both in the case of the twelve-hynde and the
twy-hyndeman the halsfang is the first beginning of the
wergeld, and whatever may be the exact meaning of
the word, it is pretty evident that it was regarded as
an admission of the wrong done and as a kind of
earnest money that the rest of the wergeld would be
paid.</p>

<p>But between the halsfang or earnest money and
the making up of the first full instalment of the
wergeld were the two other payments, the <i>manbot</i>
and the <i>fightwite</i>.</p>

<p>They have already been mentioned, but it is
important to recognise what these two payments outside
the wergeld mean.</p>

<p>We learn from c. LXXX. s. 6 what the fightwite
was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fightwite
was for
breach of

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang2of2">On whosesoever land the homicide

<div class="sidenote">Manbot

<p>It is clear from this that the fightwite was the
payment due to the lord who had the ‘soc’ of the place
where the homicide occurred and the wergeld was
pledged. The manbot, on the other hand, was the
payment to the lord whose man the person slain was.
The lord of the soc might also be the lord of the man
slain, in which case both fightwite and manbot were
payable to him.</p>

<p>In c. LXIX. the manbot of the twy-hyndeman is
stated to be 30<i>s.</i> (of 5<i>d.</i>, <i>i.e.</i> 150<i>d.</i>), and that of the
twelve-hyndeman 120<i>s.</i> (600<i>d.</i>) as in the Laws of
Ine, s. 70.</p>

<p>In the so-called ‘Laws of Edward the Confessor’

Hence the English have a proverb,
‘Buy off the spear or bear

</div>

</div>

<p>This chapter relates chiefly to the breach of the
king’s peace on the king’s highways &amp;c., but it clearly
confirms the meaning of the <i>manbot</i> as the payment
to the lord for his man and as quite distinct from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
wergeld to the <i>parentes</i> of the slain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manbot
of socheman
and
villanus
alike in
the Danelaga.</div>

<p>It may seem strange at first sight that according
to this clause the manbot in the Danelaga of the
villanus and the socheman should be alike, viz.
12 ores of silver, and further that the villanus and
socheman should not be included as <i>liberi homines</i>,
the manbot of the latter being double their manbot,
viz. three marks or 24 ores.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The explanation of the equal manbot of villani and
sochemen may partly be found in the tendency after
the Conquest to class together all subordinate tenants
rendering manual or agricultural services to the landlord
as villani, and to ignore the differences in origin
between the various classes of tenants of this kind.
Still if at this point of our inquiry the relative
positions of the sochmanni of the Danish districts and
the villani of ordinary English manors were the
question under discussion, it would be fair in explanation
of the equality in manbot to point out how
very nearly the services of the two classes seem to
have corresponded so far as their value to the lord
was concerned.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The loss to the lord of the twelve-hyndeman was
probably reckoned as of greater money value than
that of the villanus or socheman, because of the higher
grade or character of his military and judicial services
as compared with the agricultural services of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
villanus and socheman.</p>

<p>However this may be, these considerations confirm
the importance of the distinction between the <i>manbot</i>
which varies according to the value or loss to the
lord of the person slain, and is therefore payable to
him, and the wergeld payable to the <i>parentes</i> of the
person slain which varied according to the grade in
social rank in which he was born or to which he
may have sometimes risen.</p>

<p>Further, this distinction between the wergeld and
the manbot becomes all the clearer when we turn to
the evidence given in the Laws of Henry I. regarding
the custom of Wessex in respect of the homicide of
slaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When a

<p class="lang2of2">(s. 3) If the lord of the slayer
pays nothing for him and the

shall hand him over to the prosecutors

<div class="sidenote">Manbot of
Wessex
slave.</div>

<p>Thus while under the Danelaga the equal manbot
of the villanus and of the socheman was 12 ores
or 240<i>d.</i>, we learn from these clauses that the
manbot of the ordinary slave under Wessex custom
was 20<i>s.</i> <i>i.e.</i> (if of 5<i>d.</i>) 100 pence, while that of the
twy-hyndeman was, as we have seen, only 150 pence.</p>

<p>At first sight it may seem strange that the manbot
or value to the lord of his villanus or socheman
should be no greater, or even less, than that of his
theow or slave. But a moment’s consideration will
show that the value of the villanus and the socheman
to the lord was mainly their week-work and services
amounting to perhaps half their whole time, while
that of the slave or theow was the value of his whole
time and also that of a marketable chattel.</p>

<p>It may be noticed, too, how in the statements of
Wessex custom some slight recognition is made of
the <i>kindred</i> of the slave, but the amount (40 pence)
is so very small that it hardly can be reckoned as any
real approach to recognition of family rights or rights
of kindred belonging to the relatives of the slave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>In the ‘Laws of William the Conqueror’ the manbot
of the slave is stated (perhaps in error) to be twice
that of the freeman, and in the case of freemen a concession
is made of 10<i>s.</i> of the wergeld to the <i>widow</i> of
the slain, who otherwise, not being of the same blood
or kindred with her husband, would under tribal
custom have received no part of the wergeld.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homicide
of a kinsman.</div>

<p>Finally, it is interesting to observe that according
to the so-called ‘Laws of Henry I.’ tribal custom was
still partly recognised in the method of dealing with
the homicide of a kinsman.</p>

<p>In clause LXXV. is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Qui aliquem de parentibus
suis occidet, dignis apud Deum

<p class="lang2of2">He who shall slay any one of
his <i>parentes</i>, let him make amends
by fruits of penitence worthy

of the penance be according to
whether he did it willingly or by

the sponsor falls just as the manbot
of the lord. If there does not
pertain to him either the one or
the other and by the importunity
of others whose kinsman he is he
shall be compelled to pay, let it
be compounded for by judgment
of wise men whatever that may
be.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The homicide of a kinsman was apparently still
generally free from judicial interference or criminal
law. The slayer is handed over to the Church and his
punishment is spiritual penance. Even the manbot
to the lord who has lost a man through his crime fails to
be paid. But should there be a fear of trouble through
the importunity of any of the kinsmen of the slain
demanding compensation, then a compromise was to
be effected by reference to the judgment of wise men.
Tribal feeling is evidently not yet dead, although
beginning in this matter to yield to the more modern
view of individual responsibility for crime without
regard to the question of kindred. There is at the
same time recognition of the fact that the weakened
tribal feeling is no longer always able to restrain the
kinsmen from revenge in the case of wrong done
within the kindred.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>DANISH VIEW OF ANGLO-SAXON CUSTOM.</i></span></h2>

<h3>I. THE ‘DE INSTITUTIS LUNDONIE’&mdash;OF CNUT (?)</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh
point of
view.</div>

<p>Having thus tried to obtain, from the so-called ‘Laws
of Henry I.’ (whatever they may be), a Norman
view of Anglo-Saxon custom, we recognise that on
some points we may have learned more from this
Norman view than could directly have been learned
solely from the earlier Anglo-Saxon laws themselves.</p>

<p>The reason of this is obvious. Special laws issued
at various times by Saxon kings do not profess to
cover the whole ground of existing and well understood
custom. Rather should special laws be regarded
as modifications of custom made necessary at
different periods by new circumstances. Thus no one
of the sets of laws can be expected to give a general
view of custom as a whole.</p>

<p>It is not strange, then, that we should owe some
knowledge of early Anglo-Saxon custom to the
Norman Conquest and the necessity after such an
event to collect in a more connected and intelligible
form what had formerly to some extent been matters
of custom and tradition. And so it may be that our
next chance of learning more may be found in the
study of the documents and fragments belonging to
the period of the Danish invasion of England, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
especially the moment of transition from the English
rule of Ethelred II. to the Danish rule of Cnut.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danes and
English
live under
their own
laws.
Danish
law assumed
to
be well
known.</div>

<p>The founding of the Danish kingdom of Cnut was
an epoch in English history, and indeed in the history
of Europe. It was followed <i>inter alia</i> by the legalisation
in England of Scandinavian monetary reckoning
in marks and ores which had already for some time
been in use side by side with the English reckoning
in scillings and pounds. And this was typical of the
general position of things. In full coincidence with
the working of tribal feeling in other countries, into
the idea of conquest the amalgamation of the two
peoples into one did not enter. Danes continued to
live under their laws and the English under theirs,
as Franks and Gallo-Romans did under Frankish
rule. Certain things were enjoined upon both, but
with a difference. It often happens that in documents
of this period the ‘law of the English’ is specially
explained while the Danish law is referred to as
already known, thus revealing a Danish point of view.</p>

<p>In the Laws of Ethelred II. (s. 37) it is enacted
that if anyone should be charged with plotting against
the king, he must ‘clear himself with the threefold
ordeal by the law of the English, and by the law of
the Danes according as their law may be.’ And so
in the Laws of Cnut penalties are stated as so many
scillings by English law and by Danish law ‘as it
formerly stood.’<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>So that, from the Danish point of view, it was
sometimes a matter of inquiry and record what the
English law had been, while knowledge of Danish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
law was mostly taken for granted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">London
under
Cnut a
port of the
‘greater
Scandinavia.’</div>

<p>With regard to the coinage this was only partly the
case. Not that Anglo-Saxon reckoning in pounds and
scillings was abolished or that Danish currency was
thenceforth the only one allowed. But, Cnut having
styled himself ‘King of all England and King of the
Danes and Norwegians,’ London had become in one
sense a Scandinavian port.</p>

<p>The large sums paid to ‘the army’ by Ethelred
for respite and peace had flooded Scandinavia with
English silver money of his coinage.</p>

<p>This was so to such an extent that while the
British Museum is rich in the coins of Ethelred, still
more of them are to be found in Scandinavian
museums.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> And one marked result of the increased
intercourse with England was an increase also in the
Scandinavian coinage, the type of which was chiefly
taken from the coins of Ethelred II.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>London had become to some extent the commercial
capital indirectly of what has been happily called the
‘Greater Scandinavia.’</p>

<p>In the words of Mr. Keary:<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> ‘The Greater Scandinavia,
with older countries, included (counting from
the East to the West) a large district in the North
and West of Russia extending from Kiev to Lake
Ladoga. It included Sweden, Norway, Denmark and
a strip of land in North Germany (Mecklenburg),
Northern England, Man, most of the Western Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Islands, the Orkneys and Shetlands … settlements in
Ireland and colonies in the Faroes and Iceland&mdash;a
stretch of territories inhabited by peoples closely
allied in blood, in speech, and in customs.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Was it likely, then, that Cnut in making London
the commercial capital of his kingdom should adopt
the English monetary system unchanged, without
regard to that in use in the North?</p>

<p>Happily, in the document known as the ‘De Institutis
Lundonie’ we have an interesting glimpse into
the conditions of the port of London, and in its final
clause definite reference to the legalisation of the
Danish currency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The commerce
of
London.</div>

<p>This document has hitherto been placed doubtfully
under the reign of Ethelred II. with some others of
about the same period, but there is no evidence to show
that it should be so placed rather than under the
reign of Cnut. It exists only in Latin and it
contains no mention of Ethelred, while its final clause
becomes intelligible only, I think, if regarded as
enacted after the accession of Cnut.</p>

<p>We learn from the document that Aldersgate and
Cripplegate were the two gates which had guards.</p>

<p>Billingsgate, being on the river, was treated as a
port. Boats on arrival paid toll according to size,
smaller ones a halfpenny, boats with sails one penny,
‘a <i>ceol vel hulcus</i>’ fourpence if it should lie there.
Ships laden with wood paid ‘one timber’ from their
cargo. Those coming with fish to the bridge also
paid toll.</p>

<p>Men from Rouen, with wine or whale, paid six
shillings per ship and the twentieth lump of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
whale.</p>

<p>Men of Flanders, Normandy, and France declared
their cargoes and paid toll. Goods overland through
Holland and Belgium were also examined and paid
toll. Men of the Emperor who came in their ships
were to be held worthy of the same good laws as ‘our
people (<i>sicut nos</i>).’</p>

<p>From this it would appear that a good deal of
the trade from the Baltic was an overland trade and
in Frankish hands. The ‘men of the Emperor’ who
were treated on equal terms with ‘our people’ were
probably the merchants whose successors ultimately
established the Hanseatic towns and two or
three centuries later the Hanseatic league.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cnut’s
ores of
16<i>d.</i> or
1/15 of the

<p>The final clause is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">(9) Et ut monetarii pauciores

upon you and all men.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>This clause has already been alluded to in connection
with the ‘Laws of the Bretts and Scots.’ The ore
of sixteen pence in which the payments of those laws
were to be made was the ore described in this clause,
for the ore of one fifteenth of the pound was the ore
of sixteen pence.</p>

<p>The wording of the clause is very distinct. There
were to be <i>monetarii</i> (mintmen) at the several
mercantile centres, one at each lesser town and at
the chief towns three. And every weight used
by them was to be marked to the weight at which
‘my money’ was received and every one of the
weights was to be marked ‘<i>so that fifteen ores make a
pound</i>.’</p>

<p>The pound was no doubt the Frankish and English
pound which since the time of Charlemagne and Offa
contained 7680 wheat-grains and was divided according
to English reckoning into twelve ounces of 640
wheat-grains or twenty-pence of 32 wheat-grains.
The Danish ore of one fifteenth part of the pound
was therefore of 512 wheat-grains or sixteen
pence.</p>

<p>And there is good reason to believe that this ore
was the ore in general use in Scandinavian commerce.
We have seen that the Scandinavian ore, like the
Merovingian ounce, when reckoned in wheat-grains
was the Roman ounce of 576 wheat-grains, but that
in actual weight it had sunk below the Roman
standard. The ‘ortug’ or stater had apparently in
actual weight fallen back to the weight of the stater
of the ancient Eastern or Merovingian standard, viz.
8·18 grammes, so that the ore or ounce of three
ortugs of this weight would weigh 24·54 grammes.
And this was almost exactly one fifteenth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Anglo-Saxon pound.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>We may therefore with some confidence regard
the ore legalised by Cnut for commercial use as
practically identical in weight of silver with the ore
of three ortugs in use in the Baltic and generally in
Scandinavian trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cnut
divides
his ore
into 20
light
pence.</div>

<p>Moreover, when we turn to the actual coinage of
Cnut we find that by a sweeping change he reduced
the weight of the silver penny from one twentieth of
the Anglo-Saxon ounce to apparently one twentieth
of this ore, intending, it would seem, to make his ore
pass for payments as an ore of 20 pence instead
of 16.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>When these facts are taken together, we can
hardly, I think, be wrong in assigning the ‘De
Institutis Lundonie’ to the time of the foundation of
the Danish kingdom by Cnut and in considering its
final clause as recording the legalisation of the Danish
monetary system with its marks and ores for use
in England and for purposes of international trade.
The fact that the ‘ore of sixteen’ was in use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
not only in the ‘Laws of the Bretts and Scots’ but
also in the Domesday survey, <i>e.g.</i> in the district between
the Mersey and the Ribble, is a lasting proof
of its use wherever Scandinavian conquest and
commerce extended, possibly before and certainly
long after it was legalised for English use by
Cnut.</p>

<h3>II. FRAGMENT ‘OF “GRITH” AND OF “MUND.”’</h3>

<p>Having gained from the ‘De Institutis Lundonie’
some sense of the greatness of the change to England
consequent upon the accession of Cnut and also of
the importance of England to Cnut’s Scandinavian
kingdom, we may now turn to the consideration of
certain documents which seem to be attempts made
during this period of change to realise and record
what had been Anglo-Saxon custom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mund-bryce
of
the king
and of the
Church
five
pounds.</div>

<p>The first clauses of Cnut’s Church laws refer to the
maintenance of the rights of the Church as to ‘grith
and frith.’<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> ‘Because God’s grith is of all griths the
best, and next thereto the king’s, it is very right that
God’s church-grith within walls and a Christian
king’s hand-grith stand equally inviolate,’ so that anyone
infringing either ‘shall forfeit land and life unless
the king be merciful to him.’<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> A homicide within
church walls was to be ‘botless,’ unless the king
‘granted life against full bot.’ In this case the
homicide must pay his full <i>wer</i> to Christ or the king,
as the case might be, and so ‘inlaw himself to bot.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Then the bot was to be the same as the king’s ‘mund-bryce’
of five pounds.</p>

<p>These clauses seem to be taken from another
document of this period,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> headed ‘Of Church grith,’
which is printed by Thorpe among the Laws of
Ethelred.</p>

<p>Again, the laws decreed by Ethelred and his witan
at Wantage<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> respecting ‘frith-bot’ commence with
the decree that ‘grith should stand henceforth as it
originally stood in the days of his [the king’s] forefathers.’
So that again ancient custom is confirmed
rather than new law enacted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
grith of
various
moots.</div>

<p>This decree of Wantage relates, not, like Cnut’s
law, to the grith of the Church, but to the grith of
various assemblies or courts. Crimes committed within
the grith or peace given by the king’s own hand
(that is, the king’s ‘hand-grith’ of the other documents)
is again <i>botless</i>. The grith which the ealdorman
and the king’s reeve give in the assembly of
the ‘five-burgs’ if broken involves a bot of 1200 (scillings?),
that given by a burh-assembly 600, that by a
wapentake 100, that in an alehouse ‘for a dead man
vi half-marks and for a living one xii ores.’</p>

<p>In a further clause (s. 12) it is stated that in a king’s
suit the deposit or ‘wed’ was to be of vi half-marks,
in an eorl’s and a bishop’s of xii ores, and in a thane’s
of vi ores. Here both English and Danish currencies
are used. The law is common to both peoples.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The principle of the ‘grith’ or ‘frith’ is alike for
both English and Danes, and it does not seem that
Cnut had any intention of altering what had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
law in this respect under his English predecessor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grith-bryce
and
mund-bryce
the
same
thing.</div>

<p>In s. 3 of Cnut’s Church laws, dealing with crimes
less than homicide, he seems to treat the ‘grith’ of his
new law and the ‘mund-bryce’ of old law as practically
the same thing, and this clause according to
the text of MS. G.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> contains an interesting allusion
to Kentish as well as other English law.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Heafod mynstres griðbryce is

three to the archbishop, and of a
minster of the middle class cxx

where there is little service, provided
there be a burying place, lx
scillings and of a field church
thirty scillings.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Further, there is a separate document belonging
to this period entitled ‘Of <i>Grith</i> and of <i>Mund</i>’<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> which
seems to have been a careful statement of what
‘formerly’ had been law among the English, the
Kentish people, the South Angles, and the North
Angles respectively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reference
to
Kentish
law.</div>

<p>It is too long to be quoted at length. It states
again that ‘God’s grith is of all griths’ of the first
importance, and ‘next thereto the king’s.’ ‘Formerly
among the English,’ when a man fled for his life to
the king, the archbishop or the ætheling, he had nine
days’ ‘grith.’ If he sought a bishop or ealdorman he
had seven days’ ‘grith.’<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Then it goes on to state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
that in the law of the <i>Kentish</i> people ‘the king and
the archbishop had a like and equally dear <i>mund-bryce</i>,’
while the archbishop’s property according to
Kentish law was compensated for elevenfold and the
king’s ninefold, though ‘the mund-byrd of Christ’s
Church was the same as the king’s.’<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grith-law
of South
Angles.</div>

<p>Next the ‘grith-law’ of the <i>South Angles</i> is described.
The king’s mund-bryce is stated again to be
five pounds by the law of the English; an archbishop
and an ætheling’s mund-bryce three pounds; other
bishops’ and an ealdorman’s two pounds: and if any
one fight in the presence of an ætheling or archbishop
the bot was cl scillings, if in that of another bishop
or ealdorman c scillings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Law of
North
Angles.</div>

<p>Lastly, the document records that in the <i>North
Angles’</i> law ‘it stands that he who slays any one
within church walls shall be liable in his life, and he
who wounds shall be liable in his hand: and let him
who slays any one within church doors give to the
church cxx scillings, according to the North-Angles’
law. And let a freeman who harms a living person
in his “mund-byrd” pay xxx scillings.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Borh-bryce.</div>

<p>In s. 59 of the secular laws of Cnut under the
heading ‘Of Borh-bryce’ is a statement that if any one
break the king’s ‘borh’ the bot is five pounds; an archbishop’s
or ætheling’s ‘borh’ three pounds; a leod-bishop’s
or ealdorman’s ‘borh’ two pounds. This is
a re-enactment of clause 3 of King Alfred’s dooms.
In the latter the words ‘borh-bryce’ and ‘mund-byrd’
appear to be interchangeable. Both mean the breach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
of protection or <i>mund</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of
the area
of the
grith.</div>

<p>There is finally a fragment<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> which fixes the
extent of the king’s ‘grith’ to be ‘three miles and
three furlongs and three acre breadths and nine feet
and nine hand breadths and nine barleycorns from
the “burhgeat” where the king is.’</p>

<p>Within this area the ‘grith’ or protection of the
king extends, and the use of the word ‘grith’ seems to
place this fragment among those belonging to the
Danish group.</p>

<p>In this ‘grith’ or <i>area</i> of protection, taken together
with the grith of various persons in regard to the
<i>duration</i> of the protection, and the grith of the various
assemblies or courts, and, finally, in the <i>mund</i> of
various persons marked by the amount of the <i>mund-bryce</i>,
there is surely a foundation in ancient custom
for the jurisdiction involved in the sac and soc of
the later period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The soc
and sac
of later
laws.</div>

<p>We have seen in the clauses of the so-called Laws
of Henry I. allusion to the ‘sac and soc’ of the lord
on whose land a homicide has been perpetrated and
under whose jurisdiction the wed or pledge has
been given for the payment of wergeld. According
to earlier phraseology, the lord’s grith or peace has
been broken. He has a territorial jurisdiction over
the giving of the wed by which it is to be restored,
and he is entitled to fightwite accordingly. If his
own man has been slain, whether on his own land or
not, his <i>mund</i> has been broken and the manbot of his
man is payable to him. The phrase ‘soc and sac’ is
probably of Scandinavian origin. It does not seem
to go back earlier than the time of Cnut.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
found in his laws. But the principle at the root of the
‘grith’ and the ‘mund’ was not one newly introduced
at this period. We shall find it again in the earliest
laws, and we have already found it at work under
Irish custom. The Irish chieftain’s ‘precinct’ or area
of protection extended on his ‘green’ as far as he
could throw his hammer, and the value of his protection
varied, as we have seen, with his ‘honour price.’</p>

<h3>III. THE ‘FRITH’ BETWEEN ETHELRED II. AND OLAF
TRYGGVASON, A.D. 993.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Frith of
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 993.</div>

<p>The real Danish invasion of England, which ended
in the accession of Cnut to the kingdom of all England,
commenced with the arrival of Olaf (Tryggvason),
afterwards King of Norway, in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 991. The fatal
battle of Malden had been fought and 10,000 pounds
of silver paid for a temporary peace. At length the
treaty was made between Ethelred and Olaf on the
latter embracing Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freeman’s
wergeld
25 pounds

<p>The article on homicide in this ‘<i>frith-mal</i>’ is the
only one which need be quoted here:&mdash;</p>

let the Dane do the same by an
Englishman if he slay him.
If an Englishman slay a

<div class="sidenote">The freeman

<p>The points to be noted here are these. It is for
the crime of a freeman slaying a freeman that the
wergeld of twenty-five pounds is to be paid. And
this wergeld of twenty-five pounds of silver is the
wergeld of 1200 Wessex scillings. So that the freeman
of this clause is the twelve-hyndeman.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>For the purpose of this ‘frith’ between Ethelred
and Olaf the twelve-hyndeman and not the twy-hyndeman
is the typical freeman. And the Dane also is to
be paid for by a twelve-hyndeman’s wergeld.</p>

<p>The twy-hyndeman escapes without notice. No
class is mentioned between the twelve-hynde freeman
and the thrall; and the thrall whether Danish or
English is paid for with a pound of silver.</p>

<p>Finally, the compact is described in Anglo-Saxon
pounds, not in Danish marks and ores.</p>

<p>It is an English statement of the ‘frith’ between
the English king and ‘the army that Anlaf (Olaf)
and Justin and Guthmund, Stegita’s son, were with.’
And accordingly at the end of clause 7 is recorded
the humiliating admission that ‘twenty-two thousand
pounds of gold and silver were given to “the army in
England for the frith.”’</p>

A.D. 886.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The
earlier
Danish
or Viking
invasions.</div>

<p>At the date of the compact between Ethelred II. and
Olaf Tryggvason more than a century had passed
since the earlier compact between Alfred and
Guthrum. And during that century the successors
of Alfred had gradually succeeded in recovering
their hold upon the English nation. During the
whole of this time, following Continental tribal usage,
both English and Danes had presumably lived under
their own laws and customs.</p>

<p>But whether it be right to speak of the Northmen
of the time of King Alfred as Danes or not, it is
necessary to distinguish the difference between the
two invasions.</p>

<p>Cnut’s invasion was avowedly intended to establish
a kingdom, or rather to bring England within the area
of his great Danish kingdom. Olaf was on the point
of making himself King of Norway; and the founding
of kingdoms was, so to speak, in the air. It was an
era of conquest and Cnut’s invasion of England was
in fact the first step towards the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>The Vikings who invaded England in the days of
Alfred, on the other hand, were independent chieftains&mdash;the
last of the class of the early Frankish and
Anglo-Saxon type. Their invasion was not a Danish
invasion in the sense that it came from a Danish
kingdom. The Vikings of this earlier period were
chieftains of moving armies living upon the country
they invaded. Their armies were composed of Northmen,
and, again to quote the words of Mr. Keary, ‘in
the history of the Scandinavian nations they were the
representatives in the countries of their origin of a
bygone or passing order of things’&mdash;‘the opponents
of the extended sort of kingship which was the new
order of the day in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.’<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Let us for a moment follow the course of the
movements of these Viking armies which preceded
the compact between Alfred and Guthrum.</p>

<p>In 867 the ‘army’ was in the North, took possession
of York, and subdued Northumbria. In 868
Mercia was invaded, and till 871 the incursions were
practically confined to Northumbria and Mercia,
and parts of East Anglia. In 871 the invasion of
Wessex commenced, and in the same year Alfred, on
the death of his brother Ethelred, became King of
Wessex. In 874 the ‘army’ was again chiefly in
Mercia and Northumbria and began definitely to
settle in the latter. The southern half of Northumbria
became the Kingdom of York under Halfdan,
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 876.</p>

<p>The other part of the army under Guthrum proceeded
to attack Wessex, and the winter of 877-8 was
marked by the retirement of Alfred into the island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Æthelney.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compact
between
Alfred and
Guthrum.</div>

<p>In 878 came the victory of Æthandune, which was
followed by the baptism of Guthrum and the partition
of England. In 880 Guthrum and his army settled
in what became the Danelaga. And in 886 the final
compact was entered into between Alfred and
Guthrum the text of which has been preserved.</p>

<p>It will be convenient first to consider this compact
and then the various fragments of Northumbrian and
Mercian law the production or preservation of which
may be traced to this period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English
and Danes
equally
dear.</div>

<p>The text of the compact is preserved in the tenth-century
Manuscript B. Its first clause defines the
boundaries between that part of England which was
to remain English and the Danelaga. With this
matter at the moment we are not specially concerned.
Then follows the most material clause (2):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">And hi cwædon, gyf mon
ofslægen wurðe, eal we letað efen

<p class="lang2of2">And they ordained, if a man
should be slain we estimate all
equally dear, English and Danish,
<i>i.e.</i> at viii half-marks of pure gold

they also are equally dear,
either at 200 scillings.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">And gyf man cynges þegen beteo

<p class="lang2of2">And if a man accuse a king’s

with 12 king’s thanes, and if any
one accuse that man who is of
less degree let him clear himself
with 11 of his equals and with one
king’s thane.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Now, in the first place, it is evident that this text
describes the wergeld of two classes or ranks of
persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Dane and Englishman of the first class are to
be held equally dear at eight half-marks of pure
gold.</p>

<p>The other class embraces the Saxon ‘ceorl who
sits on gafol land’ and the Danish lysing. These
also are equally dear at 200 scillings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Englishman
put
on a level
with the
Norse
hauld,
at the
normal
wergeld
of 200
gold solidi
or 1200
scillings.</div>

<p>Let us look at these two classes separately. The
first class of Dane and English <i>men</i> without other
definition are to be paid for by eight half-marks of
gold. The money is Danish. Eight half-marks
contained thirty-two ores. And this, as we have seen,
at the Norse ratio of 1:8 was the same thing as
32 marks of silver. The wergeld of the hauld of the
Gulathing law we found to be most probably 30 marks
of silver. The Danish <i>man</i> of this clause thus seems
to be represented in Norse law by the hauld. In
other words, Guthrum from his point of view took the
hauld as the typical freeman, just as we found him so
taken in the Gulathing law.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that this wergeld of the
hauld was equated with 96 cows and that in its gold
value reckoned in wheat-grains it amounted to 200
Merovingian gold solidi.</p>

<p>From the English point of view it was not far
otherwise. The twelve-hyndeman with a wergeld of
1200 scillings was evidently the typical freeman
Alfred had in view. 1200 Mercian scillings of four
pence, <i>i.e.</i> 4800 pence, at the Norse ratio of 1:8
equalled 600 gold tremisses or 200 gold solidi.
1200 Wessex scillings of five pence at a ratio of
1:10 would also equal 200 gold solidi.</p>

<p>The equation was therefore well within the range
of reasonable compromise. And behind both these
wergelds&mdash;that of the hauld and of the twelve-hyndeman&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
seems to be the curious traditional
(conscious or unconscious) reference so often repeated
to the ancient normal wergeld of 200 gold solidi and
the heavy gold mina. At this normal wergeld Dane
and Englishman were to be held equally dear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English
ceorl on
gafol land
put on
a level
with the
Norse
leysing.</div>

<p>Turning now to the other class, the wergeld is
described in English scillings and the wergeld is that
of the twy-hyndeman&mdash;two hundred scillings&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> one
sixth of the wergeld of the other class. On the Danish
side the equivalent of the twy-hyndeman was the
lysing, <i>i.e.</i> the ‘leysing’ or newly made freedman of
the Gulathing law, who had not yet made his freedom-ale
and whose wergeld was one sixth of that of the
hauld ‘according to his rett.’</p>

<p>Here again the correspondence is complete. The
English twy-hyndeman is put by this compact on the
same standing as to wergeld as the Norse leysing or
newly made freedman who had not yet made his
freedom-ale.</p>

<p>But we gain another point from this remarkable
clause. We are warned by it not to be drawn
too easily into a rash generalisation from the use of
the Saxon word <i>ceorl</i>.</p>

<p>It is not the ‘ceorl’ <i>as such</i> who is the twy-hyndeman
and put upon the same social level as the
Danish lysing. It is clearly only the ‘ceorl <i>who sits
on gafol land</i>.’ It is on the last words that the
distinctive emphasis must be put. If we had nothing
but this clause to guide us we might conclude that
all above the ‘ceorl who sits on gafol land’ were
twelve-hynde.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<h3>II. THE COURSE OF PROCEDURE IN PAYMENT OF
WERGELD.</h3>

<p>There are two statements of the course of procedure
in the payment of wergelds which may conveniently
be mentioned at this point. The first
occurs in the ‘Laws of King Edmund,’ who reigned
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 940-946. And the other is contained in a
fragment belonging probably to the time following
soon after the Compact between Alfred and Guthrum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King
Edmund
makes
payment
of wergeld
voluntary.</div>

<p>King Edmund, in order to abate the ‘manifold
fightings’ resulting from the system of feud and
wergeld, made stringent regulations under which
wergelds were to be claimed, making it voluntary
on the part of the kindred to join in payment of the
wergeld.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif hwa heonan-forð ænigne

<p class="lang2of2">(Edmund Secular Laws, s. 1.)
If any one henceforth slay any
man that he himself bear the
feud unless with the aid of his
friends and within 12 months he
compensate it with the full wer;
be he born as he may be. But if
his mægd forsake him and will
not pay for him, then I will that
all the kindred be <i>unfah</i> [free
from the feud] except the perpetrator,
if afterwards they do not
give him either food or mund
[protection]. But if any one of
his kindred feed him, then be he
liable in all that he possesses to
the king and bear the feud with
the kindred because they had
previously forsaken him. But if
anyone of the other kindred take
vengeance upon any other man
than the real perpetrator, let him
be foe to the king and to all his
friends and forfeit all that he
owns.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif hwa cyrican gesece oþþe

<p class="lang2of2">(2) If any one take refuge in a
church or in my burh, and one
there seek him or do him evil, be
those who do that liable in the
same that is heretofore ordained.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">And ic nelle ꝥ ænig fyhtewite

<p class="lang2of2">(3) And I will not that any
<i>fightwite</i> or <i>manbot</i> be forgiven.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This relaxation of the rules as to payment of
wergeld seems to leave matters very much as they
were, with the one exception that for the sake of
peace and to lessen the risk of ‘manifold fightings,’ a
year was given to the slayer’s kindred to save his
life by helping him to pay the wergeld if they chose,
while if they chose to forsake him and did not
harbour or help him in any way <i>they</i> were free. The
kindred of the slain in the meantime were left to
pursue their feud but only upon the slayer. This of
course was another instance of the partial breaking
down of the ancient tribal solidarity of the kindred
in favour of the principle, long before adopted in
some of the Continental codes, limiting the punishment
of crime to the criminal himself.</p>

<p>Whether this innovation of King Edmund’s was
adhered to the evidence of the Laws of Henry I. may
lead us to doubt, but for our purpose the law making
the innovation is evidence of the ancient solidarity of
the kindred, the attempt to loosen which had become
necessary in the tenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How
wergelds
were to
be paid.</div>

<p>A clause which follows shows that it was expected
that wergelds would still be paid:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

shall be paid for.’ It opens with the statement,
‘A twelve-hyndeman’s wer is twelve hundred scillings.
A twy-hyndeman’s wer is two hundred scillings.’
And then it proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<i>werborh</i>, viii of the paternal kin
and iv of the maternal kin.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This is in accordance with the clause in Alfred
and Guthrum’s compact, which, however, makes the
additional provision by way of precaution that one
of the twelve co-swearers must be a king’s-thane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>

<p>These steps in the procedure are very nearly the
same as those quoted in the so-called ‘Laws of

upon as more or less repeating for the benefit of both
peoples what Anglo-Saxon custom may have been
before the Viking invasions of England. But of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
we cannot be certain.</p>

<h3>III. FRAGMENTS OF MERCIAN AND THE NORTH
PEOPLE’S LAW.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Fragments
preserved
of ancient
custom.</div>

<p>We now have to consider a group of fragments of
uncertain date which seem to belong to the period
of the Northmen’s settlement in Northumbria and
invasions in Mercia.</p>

<p>The settlement of the Viking invaders made it
necessary to fix the relation of their wergelds to those
of the conquered English, and also to gather up
fragments of Mercian custom. As the Dooms of
Mercian kings have not come down to us, these
fragments have a special value.</p>

<p>The importance of Mercia in King Offa’s time
gives a special interest to any information on Mercian
custom. And in other respects, scanty though it
be, the retrospect of early Anglo-Saxon custom from
the invaders’ point of view could ill be spared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Under
Mercian
law the
oath of
twelve-hyndeman
= that of
six ceorls.</div>

<p>There are two valuable fragments on Mercian
law.</p>

<p>The first is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2"><i>Be Merciscan Aðe</i></p>

<p class="lang2of2"><i>Of the Mercian Oath</i></p>

<p class="lang2of2">A twelve-hyndeman’s oath
stands for six ceorls’ oaths; because

</div>

</div>

<p>This fragment of Mercian law is preceded in the
group of fragments ‘on oaths’ in Thorpe’s edition of
the Laws by the following, which may or may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>

<p class="lang2of2">A ceorl’s wergeld is by Mercian
law cc scillings. A thane’s wergeld
is six times as much, <i>i.e.</i> xii
hundred scillings. Then is a
king’s simple wergeld vi thanes’
wer by Mercian law, <i>i.e.</i> xxx
thousand sceatts, and that is altogether
cxx pounds. So much is
the wergeld in the people’s folkright
by Mercian law. And for
the ‘Cynedom’ there is due
another such sum as <i>bot</i> for <i>cyne-gild</i>.
The wer belongs to the
kindred and the cynebot to the
people.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The Mercian wergeld of both twy-hynde and
twelve-hynde men is thus stated in scillings, as
usual, and the king’s wergeld&mdash;six times the thane’s&mdash;would
equal 7200 scillings. The Mercian scilling
was 4<i>d.</i>, and thus, as stated in the text, the king’s
wergeld would equal exactly 120<i>l.</i> or 28,800 pence
or sceatts (in round numbers 30,000 sceatts).</p>

<p>This is useful as evidence that the sceatt of this
Mercian wergeld was the silver penny of the Anglo-Saxon
currency of 28·8 wheat-grains&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of the
<i>Sceatt series</i>&mdash;before Offa and Alfred, following the
example of Charlemagne, superseded the ‘sceatt’ by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the ‘penny’ of 32 wheat-grains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fragment
of North
People’s
Law.</div>

<p>The fragments printed by Thorpe under the heading
‘North People’s Law’ and by Schmid in his
‘Anhang VII.’ seem to belong to Northumbria
or more generally to the Danelaga. Schmid suggests
that the ‘North people’ were the North folk of
East Anglia. This, however, is perhaps more than
doubtful, especially when it is considered that the
Viking ‘armies’ had established themselves, not only
in East Anglia and Mercia, but still more completely
in Northumbria, many years before the struggle
with Wessex had ended in the compact between
Alfred and Guthrum.</p>

<p>The fragment of ‘North People’s Law’<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> opens
with the statement that the king’s gild is 30,000
<i>thrymsas</i>&mdash;15,000 for the wergeld and 15,000 for the
people (<i>leodum</i>).</p>

<p>In another MS. the wording follows the statement
of Mercian law very closely, and agrees with the
above in describing the amount in thrymsas.</p>

<p>The ceorl has a twyhynde wergeld in Mercian
shillings and the thane a twelve-hynde wergeld in
Wessex shillings. There seems to be so far some
confusion. But on the whole this reckoning seems
to justify the opinion generally held that the Northmen
coming as conquerors into Northumbria or the
Danelaga had, at the date of these fragments, doubled
the wergeld of the hold or hauld as compared with
that of the English thane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergeld
of hauld
double
that of
the thane,
but after
Alfred’s
victory
both
equally
dear.</div>

<p>If, as seems reasonable, these fragments may be
referred to the period following upon the Viking
conquest and settlement in Northumbria and the
foundation of Halfdan’s kingdom of York (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 876),
then the doubled wergeld of the hauld may be
perhaps the high-water mark as it were of the invasion&mdash;the
point of vantage at which it was natural for the
conquerors to treat the conquered as a tributary
race. And if it may rightly be so regarded, then it
gives an added interest to the compact between
King Alfred and Guthrum in 886. For then, the tide
of battle having turned, the two kings at length met
on equal terms and, undoing the earlier unequal
settlement, now agreed to make Dane and Englishman
equally dear.</p>

<p>A still more interesting point than the doubling
of the conquering Hold’s wergeld as compared with
the conquered thane’s is found in the subsequent
clauses of this fragment, which seem to refer back to
ancient tradition as regards the position of the non-Saxon
subjects of Anglo-Saxon kings.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The other version is practically the same:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">And Wealisc-monnes weregild

<p class="lang2of2">(7) And a Wealisc-man’s wergeld

<p class="lang2of2">(8) If he have no land but is
free let him be paid for with lxx
scillings.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Now ‘hiwisc’ and ‘hyred’ both seem to mean
<i>family</i>. In a roundabout indirect way ‘familia’ and
<i>hide</i> meant apparently very much the same thing, but
as the word <i>hide</i> is used in the same clause the more
direct meaning may surely in this case be the important
one.</p>

<p>It is probable that these clauses are variations
or fuller expressions of the tradition described in c. 32
of King Ine’s Laws, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif Wylisc mon hæbbe hide
londes his wer bið c. xx scill., gif
he þonne hæbbe healfe lxxx scill.,
gif he nænig hæbbe lx scillinga.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If a Wylisc man have a hide
of land his ‘wer’ shall be cxx <i>s.</i>,
but if he have half a hide lxxx <i>s.</i>,
if he have none lx <i>s.</i></p>

</div>

</div>

<p>And the additional information amounts practically
to this&mdash;that the possession of a hide seems to
have been held generally equivalent to the possession
of a family homestead&mdash;family and goods&mdash;enabling
a man to pay the king’s gafol.</p>

<p>It is when we pass on from these clauses to the
next that fresh and welcome light seems to be gained
upon the connection of the growth of a family and
kindred with rise in status and social rank from a
ceorlisc or twy-hynde position to that of the Gesithcund
or twelve-hynde position. We are now no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
dealing with the Wylisc man but with the ordinary
twy-hynde ceorl. And the mention of the payments
in thrymsas reminds us that we are still looking at
things from the North people’s point of view.</p>

<p>The clauses in the two versions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>These passages are very important, as the most
direct evidence we possess of the way in which under
early Anglo-Saxon custom families became <i>gesithcund</i>
by the gradual growth of a kindred whose kinsmen,
like the odal-men of the Norse laws, could reckon
four generations in succession of sufficient landholding.</p>

<p>The evidence is all the more interesting because
it seems to come from the point of view of the Norse
or Danish invaders making inquiry respecting English
tradition and recording what had once been the
custom of the conquered districts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
precious
fragment,
with
further
information.</div>

<p>The same remark applies equally to another of
these valuable fragments&mdash;‘Of people’s ranks and

what once had been the custom of the conquered
people.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>These are the phrases of a writer looking back
with regret upon ancient custom which to him is
past or passing away.</p>

<p>After this follow clauses in one of which the
word <i>hyrede</i> and the phrase ‘having so many hides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
to the king’s <i>utware</i>’ again occur, words that seem to
suggest that this fragment, while describing ancient
English custom, hails from a somewhat similar source
as the ‘North People’s Law.’</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p>These passages we shall have to consider further
when we sum up the evidence upon the Anglo-Saxon
division of classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The ceorl
must rise
into direct
service
to the
king and
to having
a kindred
around
him.</div>

<p>But there are two peculiarities which may be
marked here as pointing to the archaic character of
these precious fragments. First, the alliteration and
rhythmical character of some of them, which points
to an early and traditional origin, and, secondly, the
direct relations of the classes mentioned to the king.
The Wilisc man has to bring forth the king’s gafol.
The ceorl who has five hides has them to the king’s
utware and he becomes gesithcund and thane-right
worthy with special duty in the king’s hall, while
the thane is all the greater when he has a thane
under him who has himself five hides to the king’s
utware and goes with his errands to the king.</p>

<p>These are marks of direct relationship and service
of the gesithcund classes to the king, to which we
shall have to recur. They seem to point to the
gesithcund class with its completeness of kindred as
a privileged class in a semi-official position and from
which the king’s officials were chosen. It is not
until this relationship by service to the king has
become established that a ceorl finds an entrance
into the gesithcund class, and he does not become
eligible for such service till he is surrounded by an
adequate kindred.</p>

<p>In the meantime we may be thankful to the
exigences of the Viking invasions for the preservation
of these valuable fragments of ancient custom which
might otherwise have been lost.</p>

<h3>I. KING ALFRED’S DOOMS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
laws not
earlier
than the
Compact
with
Guthrum.</div>

<p>In order that the examination of early Anglo-Saxon
custom may be free from the intrusion of elements
introduced by the Northmen, it is necessary to go
back to evidence of earlier date than the laws of
King Alfred. Though collected mainly from earlier
sources, these laws took their present form probably
after the Compact with Guthrum had been made.</p>

<p>They do not profess to be a full statement of
early West-Saxon law. King Alfred himself declares
that he dared not add much of his own, ‘But those
things which I met with either of the days of Ine my
kinsman, or of Offa, King of the Mercians, or of
Ethelbert&mdash;those which seemed to me the rightest
I have here gathered together and rejected the
others.’</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it will be more convenient
to refer back to King Alfred’s laws when
needful in connection with the earlier evidence
than to consider them as a separate whole.</p>

<p>There is, however, one subject upon which the
evidence of King Alfred’s laws may properly be
considered before passing on to the earlier laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Were the
terms
ceorl and
gafol-gelda
equivalent?</div>

<p>We have seen that in the Compact with Guthrum
the Anglo-Saxon ‘ceorl who sits on gafol-land’ and
who was made ‘equally dear’ at 200 scillings with
the Danish lysing was, if the words may be taken
strictly, not necessarily a typical or representative
member of the ceorlisc class as a whole. Only some
of the ceorlisc class may have been gafol-geldas on
other people’s land. It is important, therefore, to
examine whether King Alfred’s laws afford contemporary
evidence that the ceorlisc and the twy-hynde
classes were practically the same, and whether they
were, as a rule, gafol-geldas. We have seen, from
the precious fragments before quoted, that under
ancient ‘English’ law a ceorl could rise out of
the twy-hynde class and become entitled to a twelve-hynde
wergeld of 2000 thrymsas.</p>

<p>If such a statement had been found in West-Saxon
law, the inference might at first sight be that
the ceorlisc class could hardly have been mainly a
class of gafol-geldas. The laws of Alfred surely
ought to throw some light upon this important
matter.</p>

<p>In section 39 is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ceorl
below the
six-hyndeman.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang2of2">If any one fight in a ceorlisc

him make bot to the ceorl. If he

man let it increase threefoldly

<p>The ceorlisc man in this section takes the place

and twelve-hynde classes. The payments are the
bots payable to the owners for fighting within their
sacred precinct or inclosure, and the amounts following
the proportions of the wergelds of the three
classes are:&mdash;</p>

<p>In this section the ceorlisc class seems clearly to take
the place of the twy-hynde class. They seem to be
identical.</p>

<p>Section 40 gives similar evidence, in connection
with the <i>burg</i>- or <i>burh</i>-bryce or breach of the fence
of the sacred precinct.</p>

<p>There may well be some delicate significance in
the word <i>burh</i>-bryce being applied only to the
twelve-hynde or six-hynde men, and not to the ceorl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
as though the word <i>burh</i> could not be applied to the
ceorl’s homestead. His ‘flet,’ surrounded by its <i>edor</i>
or hedge, was perhaps too humble to be classed with
the moated or walled enclosure of the <i>burh</i> of the
higher landed classes without a change of epithet. But
there is nothing to show that the ceorl of this clause
is not identical with the ordinary twy-hyndeman.</p>

<p>Lastly, in sections 10 and 18 the three classes
are again described as twelve-hynde, six-hynde, and
ceorlisc; while in sections 29, 30, and 31 they are
described as twelve-hynde, six-hynde, and twy-hynde.</p>

<p>All this seems to show that for general purposes
‘twy-hynde’ and ‘ceorlisc’ were convertible terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ceorls
must be
mostly
gafol-geldas.</div>

<p>It can hardly be said that there is anything in
King Alfred’s laws making a distinction between
the twy-hynde class and the ceorlisc class. There
seems to be nothing to suggest that the twy-hynde
wergeld was confined to any particular section of
the ceorlisc class. And therefore, so far as the
laws of Alfred are concerned, the description of the
twy-hynde class in the Compact with Guthrum as
gafol-geldas equally dear with the Danish lysing
would seem to apply generally to the ceorlisc class
as a whole. And this being so, it would seem probable
that, speaking broadly, by King Alfred’s time
the chief practical division of classes had already
resolved itself into that between the landed classes
on the one hand and their gafol-paying tenants on
the other.</p>

<p>It is quite true that under King Alfred’s laws
there is the six-hynde class between the twelve-hynde
and the twy-hynde or ceorlisc class; but his laws tell
us nothing about this six-hynde class except what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
may be inferred from the fact that its members
certainly were not included in the ceorlisc class. It
can hardly be likely that King Alfred could, in his
compact with Guthrum, have confined the twy-hynde
class to the ‘ceorl who sits on gafol-land,’ leaving out
the six-hynde class altogether, if, in his laws, he
meant by the six-hynde class the ceorls who did not
sit on gafol-land. It might have been possible to
suppose that he used the word ‘ceorl’ in his laws in a
wider sense, as including both twelve-hynde and twy-hynde,
had he not introduced the six-hynde class
between them and restricted the meaning of the word
‘ceorlisc’ to the twy-hynde class. He used it apparently
to distinguish the twy-hynde from the other
classes which by inference were not ceorlisc.</p>

<p>What the six-hynde class was and what the
ceorlisc class was under West-Saxon law two centuries
earlier than King Alfred’s day must be left to be
discovered from the evidence of the Dooms of Ine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The
mund-byrd
or borh-bryce
of
various
classes.</div>

<p>In the meantime, the consideration of the position
of the ceorlisc class having brought before us the
penalties for breach of the precinct and for fighting
within the precinct of the various classes, it may be
well to consider also the evidence of King Alfred’s
laws upon the mund-byrd or borh-bryce of what we
may regard perhaps as the official classes, and in
which apparently, at this date, even the twelve-hynde
man had no part.</p>

<p>The mund-byrd or borh-bryce seems to be confined
to those in official or judicial position.</p>

<p>Already in King Alfred’s laws we have lost the
word ‘grith’ as we had already in Cnut’s laws lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the later phrase ‘sac and soc,’ but the tribal principle
underlying the meaning of the words remains the
same and becomes all the clearer as we go back in
the evidence.</p>

<p>In s. 3, the borh-bryce and mund-byrd of the
king are stated to be <i>five pounds of</i> ‘mærra pæninga,’<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
an archbishop’s three pounds, and those of the ealdorman
and lesser bishops two pounds, exactly as they
were reported to have been in Cnut’s time in the
‘grith-law’ of the South Angles.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its tribal
origin.</div>

<p>The almost indiscriminate use of the two terms in
this clause suggests again the very slight distinction
between them. The man who by giving his pledge
placed himself artificially, so to speak, under the mund
or protection of a person in a judicial position or
authority and broke his pledge became guilty of
borh-bryce or mund-byrd, it hardly mattered which.
The penalty apparently included both crimes in one.
If we might use the Brehon phrase it was the <i>eneclann</i>,
or honour price of the person whose dignity was
injured, which had to be paid.</p>

<p>But, as we have seen, these penalties were not only
personal but also connected with the sanctity of what
under Brehon law was called the ‘maigin’ or precinct.
The Brehon tract which declares the extent
of the ‘inviolable precinct’ of the ‘boaire-chief’ to
reach as far as he can throw a spear or hammer
from the door of his house, also states that those of
higher chieftains extended by multiples of this according
to their honour-price, so that the inviolable precinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of the <i>ri-tuath</i> extended to sixty-four spear-casts from
his door.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> We have already quoted a fragment fixing
the extent of the king’s ‘grith’ at ‘three miles and
three furlongs and three acre breadths and nine feet
and nine hand-breadths and nine barleycorns from
the burhgeat where the king is.’<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The ceorl
or gafol-gelda
had
a flet the
peace of
which
could be
broken.</div>

<p>Under King Alfred’s laws, as we have seen, the
penalties for breaking into this precinct and committing
crimes in it were payable to the person whose
‘peace’ was thus broken, and were not confined to
the official classes as the mund-byrd and borh-bryce
were. They went back to the tribal root-idea of the
sanctity of the hearth and homestead of every tribesman.
They extended from the king to the ceorl
through all grades. The penalties for fighting within
the precinct were practically the same in amount as
those for the breaking into it. The penalty for
fighting in the ceorlisc-man’s ‘flet’ was practically
the same as that for breaking through his ‘edor’
into it.</p>

<p>When all these penalties are put side by side in
the form of a table two points become evident.</p>

<p>First, how far removed the social position of the
twelve-hyndeman was from that of the ealdorman.
The penalty for fighting within his precinct is not
much more than a third of that of the bishop and
ealdorman, the inference being that his official
position was much lower than the ealdorman’s.</p>

<p>Secondly, when we compare the figures in the
three columns, while the burh-bryce and fightwite of
the twelve-hynde, six-hynde, and twy-hynde classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
are both graduated in proportion to their wergelds
and very closely resemble one another, it is curious
to notice that the fightwite is based upon a duodecimal
and the burh-bryce on a decimal system
of reckoning, as if they had been derived from
different original sources. If King Alfred had
originated them he would probably have made them
alike.</p>

<p>In the following statement, collected from the
several sections of King Alfred’s Laws for purposes
of comparison and future reference, the amounts are
stated in Wessex scillings of five pence.</p>

<h3>II. THE DIALOGUE OF EGBERT, ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 732-766. ECCLESIASTICAL OATHS AND
WERGELDS.</h3>

<p>There is a gulf of nearly two centuries in the
West-Saxon evidence between the laws of Alfred and
the ‘Dooms’ of Ine.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>We are taken at a leap, not only beyond all
thought of the Northmen’s invasions, but also half
a century behind another great epoch of European
importance.</p>

<p>The Empire of Charlemagne formed a kind of
watershed in Anglo-Saxon as in European history,
and was marked, as we have seen, by a permanent
change in the currency of the Western world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position
of Northumbria
before the
time of
Charlemagne.</div>

<p>The Courts of Offa and Egbert were intimately
connected with the Imperial Court of Charlemagne,
and the transition from the early Anglo-Saxon
currency of sceatts to that of the heavier pence was
a typical result of the influence of the Empire. It
may be that the supremacy of Wessex under Egbert
was indirectly another result of it.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Egbert did not extend over
Northumbria, and Northumbria had its own independent
connection with the Court of Charlemagne.
It had its own mode of monetary reckoning in
‘thrymsas,’ and from the Northumbrian fragments
already examined we have gained some glimpses
into its ancient customs.</p>

<p>The document next to be examined refers to
Northumbria, and, as it dates from the period immediately
preceding the time of Charlemagne, it helps
to bridge over the gulf between the Laws of Alfred
and Ine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egbert,
Archbishop
of York,
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 750.</div>

<p>It is in the form of a Dialogue or set of questions
put to Egbert, Archbishop of York, by his priests,
with his answers thereto, and its date may be about
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 750.</p>

<p>Egbert, Archbishop of York, was an important
figure in Anglo-Saxon history. The brother of
Eadbert, the Northumbrian king, the recipient on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
his accession to his episcopal dignity of the remarkable
letter of Bede describing the religious anarchy
of his diocese, the founder of the great school at
York, in which his pupil Alcuin was educated and
from which he migrated to the Court of Charles the
Great, Egbert was an important personage, and the
centre of beneficent influence in the Northumbrian
church and kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
Roman
and clerical
point
of view.</div>

<p>Moreover, this document, so far as it goes and
as regards the matters mentioned in it, deals with
the questions raised by it avowedly from an ecclesiastical
point of view. The great ecclesiastic
comes down upon his diocese from a wider world.
He had been educated and ordained deacon at
Rome. And just as in the monastic rules of St.
Benedict Roman weights and measures were adhered
to, so when this archbishop has to speak of money
matters, ignoring all local currencies, he still thinks
and speaks and calculates in the terms of the Roman
Imperial currency, and not in Anglo-Saxon sceatts
and scillings, or in the thrymsas of Northumbrian
usage.</p>

<p>The Dialogue contains several interesting clauses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What to
be the
value of
the oaths
of clerics.</div>

<p>The first to be noticed is in answer to the question
as to the value to be attached to the oaths of
the bishop, priest, deacon, and monk. The reply
is:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Ordines supradicti, secundum
gradus promotionis, habeant
potestatem protestandi: presbiter
secundum numerum cxx tributariorum;
diaconus vero juxta numerum
lx manentium; monachus
vero secundum numerum xxx tributariorum,
sed hoc in criminali
causa. Cæterum si de terminis
agrorum oritur altercatio, presbitero
liceat juramenti sui adtestatione
terram videlicet unius
tributarii in jus transferre æcclesiæ.
Duobus quoque diaconis id
ipsum conceditur. Testificatio
vero trium monachorum in id
ipsum sufficiat.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">The said orders according to
their grade of promotion shall
have power of protestation.
The priest to the number of
cxx tributarii; the deacon up
to the number of lx ‘<i>manentes</i>;’
the monk to the number ‘xxx
tributarii,’ <i>i.e.</i> in a criminal
cause. But if the dispute has
arisen about the boundaries of
lands it shall be lawful to the
priest on attestation of his oath
to transfer, into the right of the
church, land, <i>i.e.</i> of one <i>tributarius</i>.
To two deacons also the same
is conceded. Let attestation of
three monks suffice for the same.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Now, it seems very unlikely that such a question
as this about the value of oaths should be asked of
the Archbishop if it had already been settled by
law in Northumbria. And so we seem to see him here
making a claim and laying down a principle for the
first time in Northumbria the following of which
resulted in his priests being put upon a par with the
secular thane as regards the value of their oaths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Mercia
priest’s
oath of
same
value as
that of
the thane.</div>

<p>The principle that one man’s oath was worth
more than another’s we have seen already stated in
the undated fragment on ‘Mercian oaths,’ which
very possibly represented ancient tradition.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A twelve-hynde oath stands for six ceorls’ oaths, because if a
man should avenge a twelve-hyndeman he will be fully avenged on
six ceorls and his wergeld will be six ceorls’ wergelds (p. 360).</p>

</div>

<p>And, further, the right of the priest to be put on
equal footing with the thane we have seen recognised
in another fragment.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A mass priest’s oath and a secular thane’s are in English law
reckoned of equal value, and by reason of the seven church
degrees that the mass priest through grace of God has acquired,
he is worthy of thane-right (p. 361).</p>

</div>

<p>The same principle was recognised in the further
fragment on the North People’s wergelds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual statement in Continental and Anglo-Saxon
laws as regards compurgation is that a man
must clear himself by his oath and the oaths of so
many oath-helpers. But in the Laws of Ine, with
which the Archbishop was doubtless conversant, another
method was followed in some cases. A man
must clear himself, not with the oaths of so many
oath-helpers, but with an oath of so many <i>hides</i>.
The claim of the Archbishop seems to favour the
view, suggested but hardly established by various
passages in the Laws of Ine, that the twelve-hyndeman’s
oath was reckoned at 120 hides.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Oaths of
so many
hides.</div>

<p>All that one can say is that the Archbishop in
claiming that the Northumbrian priest’s oath should
be regarded as one of ‘120 tributarii’ seems to have
had in his mind what was afterwards generally conceded,
<i>i.e.</i> that the priest should be put, in social
position, on a par with the thane or twelve-hynde
man. Moreover, the Archbishop’s use in this connection
of the phrase ‘so many <i>tributarii</i>’ or
‘<i>manentes</i>,’ instead of so many ‘hides,’ is interesting.
It helps us to understand that the hide as used in
the Laws of Ine was probably the same fiscal or
gafol paying unit as the <i>familia</i> of Bede.</p>

<p>Another clause in this interesting document
bears more directly upon the question of homicide,
and it is valuable as giving information quite independent
of the Laws.</p>

<p>It is the answer of the Archbishop to the question,
‘What if a layman shall kill a cleric or a monk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
whether the <i>precium sanguinis</i> according to the law
<i>natalium parentum</i> shall be paid to his near relations
or whether his <i>seniores</i> are to be satisfied by a larger
amount&mdash;which does your Unanimity sanction?’</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p>The wergelds here stated for the clergy are stated
in <i>sicli</i> and <i>argentei</i>. The Roman argenteus, as we
have seen (after Nero’s time), was the drachma of
silver, and the siclus was a didrachma or quarter of
an ounce. The Archbishop, therefore, was claiming
200 ounces of silver as the wergeld of his Northumbrian
priest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stated
in Roman
silver
currency.</div>

<p>Whether he knew it or not, this amounted in
value to 4000 sceatts (of 20 to the ounce), <i>i.e.</i> 800
Wessex and 1000 Mercian scillings. So that in
claiming for his priest a wergeld of 200 ounces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
silver he does not seem to have had in his mind
either the Mercian or the Wessex twelve-hyndeman’s
wergeld, of 1200 scillings, of 5 or 4 sceatts, but,
possibly, as we shall see, a Kentish wergeld of 200
Kentish scillings of 20 sceatts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Priest’s
wergeld
to be 200
Roman
ounces of
silver.</div>

<p>The Archbishop’s claim falling short of what was
ultimately granted in Northumbria is curious as
showing that Northumbrian law, at this time, before
the inroads of the Norse invaders, was still unsettled,
and that the Archbishop may have been influenced
by Kentish rather than by West-Saxon or Mercian
precedents. It was after another century, and after
the Norse invasion and conquest, that the wergelds
of the mass-thane and secular-thane in the ‘North
People’s Law’ were stated to be alike at 2000
thrymsas, or 1200 Wessex shillings. How much
earlier the equation was made in Northumbria we
know not.</p>

<p>The next clause to be noticed is that in reply to
question viii., viz. ‘If any monks shall mix themselves
up with sacrilege, should <i>you</i> now prosecute,
if the avengement of the crime pertains to laymen
who are their relations?’</p>

<p>The reply is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="lang2of2">The Apostle declares that all
ecclesiastical causes should be
settled by priests. But if any
ecclesiastics have perpetrated
any crime among laymen, homicide
or fornication or theft, it
has been decreed that they be
followed up in every case by laymen
against whom they have
sinned, unless it be the intention
of the Church to make satisfaction
for them. But laymen who shall
have joined in sacrilegious intercourse
with nuns [shall be dealt

the public law decrees fornicators
to be punished, but <i>double</i>&mdash;by the

adulterers to give to the Church
lx <i>argentei</i>, because severe cases
require severer and sharper cures.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This passage once again makes it clear that in
this ecclesiastical document of the Archbishop of
York 30 sicli = 60 argentei or Roman drachmæ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical
causes to
be settled
by priests.</div>

<p>And, apart from this monetary question, the
clause is interesting as marking the claim that all
ecclesiastical causes should be settled by the clergy
themselves.</p>

<p>In case of crime by an ecclesiastic against a
layman the Church reserved the right to stop the
layman’s prosecution by payment of the wergeld or
other satisfaction. At the same time the Church
was to claim double compensation from laymen
committing crime against nuns. It is impossible to
disassociate this document from the letter of Bede
describing the religious anarchy of the diocese caused
by the abuses of the loose monastic system in vogue,
and urging the newly appointed prelate, who was
not yet Archbishop, to undertake their energetic
reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Church
succumbed
to the
wergeld
system.</div>

<p>But for the present purpose the real worth of
these statements is the independent evidence they
give of the continued strength of the wergeld system
and the force of tribal custom in the Northumbrian
kingdom before the Norse invasions. The sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
individualism in Christianity was opposed to the
solidarity and joint responsibility of the kindred.
But instead of fighting against the wergeld system
the Church had actually succumbed to it, and
adopted it for its own advantage, placing a money
price upon the blood of its several ecclesiastical
ranks, making the value of the priest four times that
of the monk.</p>

<p>The system of compurgation, again, was a part of
tribal usage. The Church adopted it and graduated
the worth of the oaths of its various grades according
to secular usage, making the oath of the priest in
evidence four times the value of that of the monk.</p>

<p>In other words, in England, as on the Continent,
the clergy, instead of combating tribal custom in
these matters, took their place in the order of secular
rank according to their several grades, bishops
claiming the wergeld of princes, and priests that of
thanes, with, however, the obviously useful reservation
that if their secular rank by parentage and
birth should be higher than their ecclesiastical grade,
the higher wergeld should be theirs.</p>

<p>All this we see in the course of being introduced
into Northumbrian usage in answer to local inquiry
and local needs, upon the authority of perhaps the
very wisest of Saxon prelates.</p>

<p>The wisdom of such accommodation as this on
the part of the Church to pagan tribal usage is not
the matter in question. The point of the evidence
is the proof it gives of the continued strength of
tribal usage in England after many generations of
occupation and settlement.</p>

<h3>III. THE DOOMS OF INE, A.D. 688-725.</h3>

<p>The Dooms of King Ine occupy so important a
position as the earliest direct information upon Anglo-Saxon
custom apart from Kent that they demand
careful separate study.</p>

<p>We ought to be able to learn something from them
of the aim and spirit of legislation in Wessex two
centuries before King Alfred added them to his laws.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Ine’s
Dooms
apart from
Alfred’s.</div>

<p>There is no reason, I think, to suspect that the text
of the Dooms of Ine was altered by Alfred. The words
already quoted in which he says that in his Dooms he
collected together what he thought ‘rightest’ of those
things which he met with of the days of Ine and
Offa and Ethelbert without adding much of his own
are quite consistent with his preservation of King
Ine’s laws as a whole, though in some points differing
from his own.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>King Ine came to the throne in A.D. 688, and he
states in his preamble that he issued his ‘Dooms’
with the counsel of Cenred his father and of the
Bishops of Winchester and London (who had already
had twelve or thirteen years’ experience in their sees)
and also with the counsel of all his <i>ealdormen</i> and
his Witan:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
ealdorman

in

position.</div>

<p>We mark, then, at once that at this period the
most prominent public official was the <i>ealdorman</i>.
From clause 8 and clause 9 we learn that private
revenge for a wrong was forbidden before justice had
been demanded from a ‘“scir-man” or other judge.’
And that the ealdorman was a shire-man we learn
from another clause (clause 36).</p>

forfeit his ‘shire’ unless the King

</div>

<p>Here, as in Alfred’s Laws, the ealdorman is an
official with judicial jurisdiction. And we learn more
about his social status as compared with that of
other classes from s. 45.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burg-bryce

of a <i>gesithcund</i>-man having land
with xxxv shillings: and <i>according
to this let them make legal
denial</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The <i>burg</i>-bryce is the same thing as the <i>burh</i>-bryce&mdash;the
breaking into the <i>burh</i>. And if we
compare the ‘bots’ of this clause with the <i>burh</i>-bryce
of King Alfred’s s. 40 (<i>supra</i>, p. 372) we see that
he was not merely copying King Ine’s clause. Nearly
as they may resemble one another, there are marked
differences between the two clauses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>The king’s burh-bryce in King Ine’s Laws is the
same as King Alfred’s. The ealdorman’s is eighty scillings
instead of sixty. The king’s thane takes the
ealdorman’s place with sixty, and the gesithcund-man’s
burh-bryce in King Ine’s Laws is practically the same
as the twelve-hyndeman’s in King Alfred’s laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
gesithcund-man’s
judicial
position.</div>

<p>The gesithcund-man we have met before in
one of the fragments of early English law, but so
far as relates to Wessex he appears in the Dooms of
Ine for the first and last time, and we shall have to
consider by-and-by how far he is the same person as
the twelve-hyndeman. But for the present it is
sufficient to note that he is mentioned along with the
king’s thane and the ealdorman apparently in order
to state the extent to which his oath was to be taken
as valid in judicial evidence, or whatever is meant by
the words ‘and according to this make legal denial.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laws as
to theft.</div>

<p>The chief obstacle to the maintenance of the peace
seems to have been the frequency of thefts and
homicide of all kinds. The connection between homicide
and theft is the subject of several clauses in the
Laws of Ine. And as they bring into notice the
liability of the kindred it may be well to consider
them in order.</p>

<p>These are some of the clauses in the Laws of King
Ine with reference to the slaying of a thief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif þeof sie gefongen swelte
he deaðe oþþe his lif be his were
man aliese.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(12) If a thief be seized let him
perish by death or let his life be
redeemed according to his wer.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Cierlisc mon gif he oft betygen
wære gif he æt siþestan sie
gefongen slea mon hond [of] oþþe
fot.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(18) A ceorlisc man, if he have
often been accused, if he at last
be seized, let his hand or foot be
cut off.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif feorcund mon oþþe fremde
butan wege geond wudu gonge &amp;
ne hrieme ne horn blawe, for
þeof he bið to profianne oþþe to

<p class="lang2of2">(20) If a far-coming man or a
stranger journey through a wood
out of the highway and neither
shout nor blow his horn he is to
be held for a thief either to be
slain or redeemed.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The ge-geldas
and
kindred of
the thief.</div>

<p>Then comes the question what happens if a man
should seize a thief and slay him as a thief. The
next clause goes on to state that in the case of the
thief slain in the wood the slayer must declare that
he slew the man for a thief, and then neither the lord
nor the <i>ge-gildas</i> of the slain could demand a wergeld.
But if he should conceal the slaying and it became
known after a time, the way was open for the kindred
of the supposed thief to exculpate him by oath and so
claim his wergeld, from the slayer.</p>

<p>Where there is no concealment, the kindred of
the thief must swear that there shall be no vengeance
on him for delivering up the thief.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Se [þe] þeof gefehð [he] ah x.
scill. ⁊ se cyning þone þeof ⁊ þa
mægas him swerian aðas unfæhða.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(28) He who seizes a thief shall
have ten scillings and the king
the thief; and let the kindred [of
the thief] swear to him oaths of
‘unfæhthe.’</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>If the man who had seized the thief let him go
he was liable to pay ‘wite’&mdash;and if, as we have seen,
an ‘ealdorman’ did so it was at the risk of losing
his ‘shire.’</p>

<p>Theft seems to have been an increasing crime, for
further on in Ine’s Laws there are repetitions of
some of these clauses, with slight additions, showing
that the Dooms of Ine were added to from time to
time (s. 35 and s. 27).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ceorlisc
and
the gesithcund
classes.</div>

<p>We have seen how severe a penalty was attached
to the crime against the king’s peace of letting a thief
once seized escape. The following clause is still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
severe upon any one harbouring a fugitive thief or
other outlaw, and it introduces again the division of
classes as regards wergelds into gesithcund and
ceorlisc, but without mentioning the wergelds of each
class.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif mon cierliscne monnan
flieman-feorme teo be his agnum

swa be his were.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(30) If a man accuse a
ceorlisc-man of harbouring a
fugitive [thief?] let him clear
himself according to his own wer.
If he cannot, let him pay for him
according to his own wer, and the
gesith-man in like manner according
to his wer.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This ‘clearing himself according to his own wer’
alludes evidently to the oath of himself and his oath-helpers
and shows that the oath required to clear
the gesithcund-man from the charge was a greater
one than that required to clear a ceorlisc-man. This
was doubtless the case throughout, but apparently it
had become needful to strengthen the oath of both
classes. The following clause required that in the
oath of both the gesithcund and ceorlisc-man in denial
of homicide there should be among the oath-helpers
‘a King’s oath of 30 hides.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The oaths

<p class="lang2of2">(54) He who is charged with
<i>wer-fæhthe</i> and he is willing to
deny the slaying on oath; then
shall there be in the ‘hynden’ one
king’s oath of 30 hides as well
for a gesithcund-man as for a
ceorlisc-man whichever it may
be. If he has to pay him, then
may he give the man of any one
of those ‘hyndens’ a coat of mail
and a sword in the wergeld if he
need.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>The last part of the clause is ambiguous, but
on the whole, taking into account the Latin of the
‘Quadripartitus’ and Liebermann’s suggested translation
and the difficulty of the various other suggested
readings, I think it is most probable that the meaning
may be, that if the man charged cannot get the
required ‘king’s oath’ or that of another hynden
without paying for it, he may give ‘a coat of mail
and a sword’ to the ‘hynden’ if it should be needful.
We may have to recur to this section, but without
attempting to build anything upon this more than
doubtful addition to it. Nothing important, I think,
turns upon it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Both
classes

<p>The following is important as showing that both
the gesithcund and ceorlisc classes were under the
military obligation to follow to the fyrd.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(51) If a gesithcund-man owning
land neglect the fyrd, let him
pay 120<i>s.</i> and forfeit his land,
one not owning land 60<i>s.</i>; a ceorlisc-man
30<i>s.</i> as fyrd-wite.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The recurrence in so many clauses of Ine’s Laws
of the division of classes into gesithcund and ceorlisc
leads to the conclusion that it must have been a very
prominent one.</p>

<p>It was accepted in the Laws of Ine as a fact
existing and of common knowledge, with no mark
upon it of novelty or innovation. The distinction
was evidently ancient and radical, and yet the word

<div class="sidenote">Mention

<p>Throughout the 76 clauses of the Laws of Ine
only one makes direct mention of the division of
classes into twelve-hynde and twy-hynde, the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
so generally made in the later laws, and in this
clause, as in King Alfred’s Laws, the six-hynde class
also appears:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Aet twy-hyndum were mon

<p class="lang2of2">(70) With a twy-hyndeman’s

</div>

</div>

<p>The man-bot was, as we have seen, the payment to
a lord for the loss of his man.</p>

<p>There is an indirect mention of wergelds in s. 34,
which states that any one who has been in a foray
in which a man has been slain must prove himself
innocent of the slaying and make bot for the foray
according to the wergeld of the slain. If his wergeld
be 200<i>s.</i> he must make bot with 50<i>s.</i>, and the like
justice was to be done with respect to the ‘dearer
born.’</p>

<p>We may assume from this and the later evidence
that already the wergeld of the twelve-hyndeman
was 1200 scillings, and that of the twy-hyndeman
200 scillings, though in the Dooms of Ine this is not
otherwise directly stated. The laws take it for
granted that the amount of the wergelds was common
knowledge, as in so many other cases.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The six-hynde
class.</div>

<p>The mention of the six-hynde class in addition to
the twelve-hynde and twy-hynde classes makes it a
matter of importance to learn what manner of
persons were included in the six-hynde class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>The Laws of King Alfred, as we have seen,
generally mention the six-hyndeman with the other
classes, but without giving any clue to an answer to
the question to what social rank he belonged. In
the Laws of Ine, however, a distinct clue is given,
and it is one which accords with Continental usage
and suggests a reason for the disappearance of the
six-hyndeman from the later laws. He is mentioned
again after King Alfred’s time only in the so-called
Laws of Henry I.</p>

<p>The clauses relating to this subject are important
enough to claim consideration in a separate
section.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The gafol-gelda
and
the gebur.</div>

<p>One other important social distinction, or division
of classes, appears already in the Laws of Ine,
viz. that which existed between possessors of land
and <i>gafol-geldas</i> and <i>geburs</i> who were, as we should
say, <i>tenants</i> on the land of others. We shall have
to return to the consideration of this distinction and
to note the fact that it is in these Laws of Ine that the
<i>gebur</i> appears as almost the equivalent of the <i>gafol-gelda</i>,
while they afford incidental evidence also
that the typical holding of the gafol-gelda (and thus
of the gebur) was the ‘yardland’ or virgate of
open-field husbandry.</p>

<p>The mention of the gafol-gelda and the gebur
occurs in s. 6.</p>

<p>This clause is intelligible if we follow the principle
that fighting anywhere is a breach of the king’s
peace. The king, therefore, in every case and
wherever it happens is entitled to a wite of 120
scillings. But if it happens within the house or
precinct of an ealdorman or of any other chief
member of the Witan the amount is divided between
the king and his official. If the fighting is in the
precinct or house of a gafol-gelda or gebur the king
still gets his full wite of 120 scillings, and an additional
six scillings is to be given to the gebur,
just as in King Alfred’s Laws the same amount is
to be given to the ceorlisc man for fighting in his
‘flet.’</p>

<p>This clause forms a valuable groundwork of
evidence as to the position of the gafol-gelda under
West Saxon law, and we shall have to recur to it
when we further consider the position of the ceorlisc
class at the date of King Ine’s Dooms. The omission
of the gesithcund class from this section, unless
included as distinguished members of the Witan,
can hardly be accidental, but it is not easy at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
sight to divine a plausible reason for it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us for a moment try to recognise the position
to which so far the Dooms of Ine have brought us.</p>

<p>We seem able in those already quoted to trace
a process at work combining distinctions of classes of
different origins and based upon different lines of
thought.</p>

<p>We find a very marked and prominent division of
classes into gesithcund and ceorlisc alongside of
hardly more than incidental mention of the division
of classes so prominent afterwards into twelve-hynde
and twy-hynde. In King Alfred’s Laws we could trace
no practical distinction between the twy-hynde and
ceorlisc classes. We could not distinguish between
them. All distinction at any rate evaded our notice.
We have now to ask the double question what was
the distinction between gesithcund and twelve-hynde,
as well as what was the distinction between ceorlisc
and twy-hynde.</p>

<p>The chief question raised by King Alfred’s Laws
was whether any great distinction existed between
the ‘ceorl who sits on gafol land’ and other
members of the ceorlisc class. The Laws of King
Alfred gave us no clue on this point. It seemed
as though, after all, the ceorlisc class must have
been so generally gafol-geldas that practically the
twy-hynde and ceorlisc class might be spoken of
roughly and inclusively as ‘ceorls who sit on gafol
land,’ and that this ‘sitting on gafol land’ might be,
after all, the fairly distinctive mark of the ceorlisc
class for whom King Alfred claimed a twy-hynde
wergeld as ‘equally dear’ with the Danish lysing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The gafol-gelda
and
gebur of
Ine’s laws
put in the
place
of the
ceorlisc
man
of King
Alfred.</div>

<p>And now in this clause 6 of King Ine’s Laws we
find the gafol-gelda or gebur put directly into the
place of the ceorlisc man of King Alfred’s Laws with
the same penalty of six scillings payable to him for
fighting in his house or his ‘flet.’</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<div class="lang1of2">

<p class="center"><i>King Alfred’s Laws</i>, s. 39.</p>

him pay … to the gebur six
scillings.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p>It might be said at first sight that here surely is a
clear trace of the degradation of the ceorl into a gafol-gelda
during the 200 years between the Laws of King
Ine and King Alfred. For, it might be said, the ceorl
of King Alfred’s Laws has the same bot for the fighting
in his house as that which the gafol-gelda had under
Ine’s Laws 200 years earlier. This may be so. But
how do we know that the gafol-gelda of King Ine’s
time was not already the typical ceorl as he seems to
have been in King Alfred’s time? In that case there
would be no sign of degradation of the ceorl into the
gafol-gelda. Or at any rate if there had been a degradation
from some original higher position and status
it had already taken place before the time of King
Ine. Our judgment on the position of the ceorlisc
class under King Ine’s Laws must still be reserved.</p>

<h3>IV. THE POSITION OF STRANGERS IN BLOOD UNDER
KING INE’S LAWS.&mdash;THE SIX-HYNDEMAN.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Strangers
in blood.</div>

<p>The question of the position under West Saxon
law of strangers in blood is one of much interest,
and we have reserved the clauses relating to it for
separate consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>There may have been several different classes of
strangers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How were
the earlier
conquered
inhabitants
treated?</div>

<p>How far there was a considerable substratum of
conquered Romano-British inhabitants is a very
vexed question. That there were such in the outlying
and recently conquered districts is certain.
Mr. Coote’s view may not be wholly mistaken that a
Romano-British population, living, as on the Continent,
under their own laws and customs, existed in
most districts, especially in the towns.</p>

<p>These strangers may some of them have had land
and some of them not. Certainly not all of them
were regarded as theows or thralls.</p>

<p>To what class, then, did they belong? And how
were they treated? What degree of freedom was granted
them, and what was their wergeld, if they had any?</p>

<p>It is to the Laws of Ine that we must go for the
answers to these questions. And we start on the
inquiry seeking light also upon the position of the
as yet unexplained six-hynde class so often mentioned
in the Laws of King Alfred but never in the later
laws.</p>

<p>The only hint we have had as yet as to the meaning
of the six-hynde class is whether gesithcund-men not
having land may not have belonged to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>wealh</i>
or <i>Wilisc-man</i>
with
five hides
was six-hynde.</div>

<p>The wergelds of the ordinary classes of tribesmen
were doubtless too well known to require more than
incidental mention in King Ine’s Dooms, but there
are several clauses or fragments of clauses specially
mentioning the wergelds of the <i>wealh</i> and of the
<i>Wilisc</i>-man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Wealh gif he hafað fif hyda he
bið syx hynde.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(24) A <i>wealh</i> if he have five
hides ‘he shall be six-hynde.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif Wylisc mon hæbbe hide
londes his wer bið c.xx scill. gif

gif he nænig hæbbe lx scillinga.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(32) If a Wylisc-man have a
hide of land his wer shall be cxx
scillings, but if he have half a hide
lxxx scillings, if he have none lx
scillings.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Cyninges hors-wealh seþe him

<p class="lang2of2">(33) The king’s ‘horse-wealh’
who can do his errands, his
wergeld shall be cc scillings.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>It will be noticed that the wergeld of the
<i>Wilisc</i> man with one hide of land is one fifth of
the wergeld of the <i>wealh</i> with five hides, so that
wealhs and Wilisc men seem to be treated on the
same lines&mdash;as if the two words meant the same
thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gallo-Roman
‘<i>wala</i>.’</div>

<p>It is not easy to draw a distinction between the
‘wealh’ and the ‘Wilisc’ man. ‘Wilisc’ is certainly
used as the adjective corresponding to ‘wealh,’
though sometimes (as <i>e.g.</i> in ‘Wilisc ale’) for something
specially Welsh. In the Lex Salica, as we have
seen, the Gallo-Roman living under Roman law,
according to the Malberg gloss was a ‘<i>Wala</i>’ with a
wergeld half that of the ‘ingenuus’ living under
Salic law. And, without pushing this meaning so far
as Mr. Coote was inclined to do, we may fairly, I
think, look upon the word ‘wealh’ as generally
embracing not only natives of Wales and West Wales,
but also the wider class of persons of the conquered
populations, whether Welsh or Britons or Romano-Britons,
who were not recognised as of Anglo-Saxon
blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Wallerwente</i>
of
Yorkshire.</div>

<p>We may call in the later evidence of the
Northumbrian Priest-law<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> in illustration. The use of
ores and half-marks in this document and its being, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
to speak, domiciled in York, seem to connect it with
the period of the Northmen’s conquest of Northumbria,
when York was its capital and as yet the tide of
battle had not been turned&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> shortly before the
date of the Compact between Alfred and Guthrum.
In this Priest-law the penalty for the practice of
heathen rites on the part of a king’s thane was ten
half-marks, and if he wished to deny the charge it
must be with ten named by himself, ten named by
his kindred (<i>maga</i>), and ten <i>Wallerwente</i>, and if he
failed in the denial he had to pay the ten half-marks,
half of which went to the church and half to
the king.</p>

<p>And so also in the case of the ‘landagende man’
who had to pay six half-marks: he too must deny
with as many of his like (<i>gelicena</i>) and as many
<i>wente</i> as the king’s thane. And so also in the case
of a ‘cyrlisc’ man.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that these <i>Wallerwente</i> were <i>free</i>
inhabitants of the district, for their oaths were
taken in evidence, which would not have been done
had they been theows. The Wallerwente were,
on the other hand, not recognised as ‘ceorlisc’
Saxons. They were obviously the native Celtic
inhabitants of the great plain of York<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>&mdash;the <i>gwent</i>
or basin of the Derwent and the Ouse. The locality
is fixed by the clause which restricts the Sabbath
day’s journey on necessity to six miles out of
York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Under
Frankish
law the
Gallo-Romans
had half-wergelds.</div>

<p>Now, we have seen that under Frankish laws the
Gallo-Roman population living under Roman law
had <i>half</i>-wergelds. If the freeman living under Salic
law had a wergeld of 200 solidi the ‘Romanus
possessor’ had a wergeld of 100 solidi. And so in
the same way, returning to the Laws of Ine, while
the gesithcund or other landed Wessex freeman was
a twelve-hyndeman, the wealh who had five hides
was reckoned as six-hynde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
wealh
with five
hides had
a half-wergeld.</div>

<p>We have seen that the English ceorl who rose to
the possession of five hides and paid gafol to the
king, and with coat of mail and over-gilded sword
followed to the fyrd, became gesithcund with a wergeld
of 1200 scillings. It is quite in accordance
with tribal feeling as shown in Continental usage that
the stranger in blood, whether Welsh or Romano-British,
who had risen in the same way to the
possession or occupation of five hides should be six-hynde
with a half-wergeld of 600 scillings.</p>

<p>We have quoted the Northumbrian Priest-law
and noted that its penalties in half-marks and ores
suggest that it belongs to the period before King
Alfred’s Compact with Guthrum, during which
York was the capital of the Northmen’s kingdom.
It is interesting to see that in the fragment of North
People’s Law quoted in the previous chapter, belonging
probably to the same district and to the same
period, some of the clauses with reference to the
Wilisc man are evidently copied from the Laws of
Ine though with some additional matter and perhaps
some slight errors in the figures.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And if a Wilisc-man thrive so that he have a hide of land and
can bring forth the King’s gafol, then is his wergeld 120 scillings.
And if he thrive not except to half a hide, then let his wer be 80<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
scillings. And if he have not any land, let him be paid for with
70 scillings [? 60].</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The conquering
Northmen
gave the
hauld a
wergeld
twice that
of the
thane.</div>

<p>And it is worth notice that it was in this very
document that the Northmen as conquerors, while
leaving the English wergeld of the thane at 2000
thrymsas or 1200 scillings, gave to their own ‘hold’
a double wergeld of 4000 thrymsas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The six-hynde
class died
out.</div>

<p>We may therefore regard the six-hyndeman of
King Ine and King Alfred’s Laws as probably the
Wilisc man with five hides or more. There does not
appear to be anything in King Alfred’s Laws to lead
us away from this conclusion. Any other would
leave the complete silence of King Alfred’s laws with
regard to the Wilisc class unexplained, unless it could
be considered that in the turmoil of the Northmen’s
invasions and the stress of war the Wilisc class had
already become more or less amalgamated with the
Saxon population by the force of their common
interests against the invaders.</p>

<p>The silence of the later laws as to a six-hynde
class may probably be explained by the same considerations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wilisc
man under
Ine’s law
only half
as worthy
as the
Englishman.</div>

<p>Passing from the Wilisc man who was six-hynde
in consequence of his landed position to the Wilisc
man viewed simply as a stranger in blood, there is
further evidence that as a stranger he was regarded
as only half as ‘worthy’ as an Englishman. In
s. 46 of Ine’s Laws it is stated that an oath-worthy
person charged with theft is to deny the charge with
an oath of 120 hides if the accuser be an Englishman,
but with only 60 hides if the accuser be a Wilisc
man.</p>

</div>

<p>This clause does not tell us whether the Wilisc
man was considered to be oath-worthy or not.
Probably he would not be as against a Saxon. It
only states that when the charge of theft was made
by an Englishman the oath was to be one of twice
as many hides as would be required to deny the
charge of a Wilisc man.</p>

<p>Corroborative evidence as regards the half-wergelds
and oath-worthiness of the wealh class may be
found in an ordinance of later date, but belonging to
Wessex, and it may be quoted as throwing strong
light upon the position of the Wilisc or wealh class
(<i>wealþeode</i>) in apparently a border district, where
Saxons and wealhs met together with a boundary of
a river between them. It is entitled an ‘Ordinance
respecting the Dun-setas.’<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>The leading fact throughout this document is
that the two peoples met avowedly as strangers.
Its aim was to keep the peace and to protect the
owners of cattle on each side of the stream from the
raids of their neighbours on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>They are recognised as strangers to each other
and on principle treated reciprocally as such. Denial
of a charge by oath and oath-helpers, unless by
special agreement, is assumed to be of no use and
evidently out of place between strangers in blood.
Consequently the ordeal was the only answer to a
charge of theft.</p>

<p>In this document the wealh is treated according
to tribal principle as a stranger in blood, both as
regards recourse to the ordeal, and the half-wergeld.
And the word ‘wyliscne’ is used as the appropriate
adjective distinguishing the wealh from the Englishman.
So that in this case ‘wealh’ and ‘wylisc’ mean
the same thing. Further, this evidence, though later
in date probably than King Alfred’s Laws, is practically
Wessex evidence, because, though the geographical
position of the Dun-setas is not accurately

<p>Returning to the Laws of Ine, as the wergeld of the
Wilisc man with five hides was a half-wergeld of
600 scillings it might be supposed that the ordinary
Wilisc man’s would be a half-wergeld of 100 scillings.
But it was not exactly so, for, according to s. 32 above
quoted, the Wilisc man with one hide had a wergeld
of 120 scillings, one with half a hide 80 scillings, one
without any land 60 scillings.</p>

<p>In an isolated clause added to s. 23 a somewhat
different statement is made. The wealh gafol-gelda
has the same wergeld as if he had a hide of land,

<h3>V. THE TWELVE-HYNDE AND TWY-HYNDE MEN AND
THEIR HYNDENS OF OATH-HELPERS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The meaning
of
twelve-hynde
and
twy-hynde.</div>

<p>The silence of the Dooms of Ine upon some of the
most important matters relating to ancient custom
is no doubt disappointing, but their position as
almost our only direct evidence of the customs of
Wessex for the first two or three centuries after the
conquest of Britain gives to every hint a value.
Some of the clauses are so isolated that if we could
not approach them with light from other sources we
should lose the right clue to their meaning. It is
only by following the course we have adopted of
working backwards from the known to the unknown
that we can rightly interpret some of the clauses by
reading into them some things not directly mentioned
by them.</p>

<p>And yet if we try to understand such a fundamental
matter as the meaning of the division of classes
into <i>twelve-hynde</i> and <i>twy-hynde</i><a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> it is to the Dooms of
Ine that we must go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Connected
with the
system of
oath-helpers.</div>

<p>It is in these Dooms that the meaning of the words
twelve-hynde and twy-hynde is most clearly connected
with the system of compurgation and the oaths of
the oath-helpers. It is moreover in these Dooms that
at first sight the mystery is made still more mysterious
by the statement of the value of the oaths in so many
hides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
oaths in
hides.</div>

<p>The fact of this connection between the value of
the oaths and hides was first brought to our notice
in the Dialogue of Archbishop Egbert apparently as a
matter already well known and established. And it
was his claim that the oaths of his priests should be
reckoned as oaths of 120 hides which confirmed what,
from the Laws of Ine, was hardly more than doubtful
inference that this was the value of the oath of the
gesithcund or twelve-hynde class.</p>

<p>The Archbishop’s mention of it confirmed it, but
left its meaning and origin as obscure as ever. And
yet the whole question of the structure of Saxon
society is so mixed up with the right understanding
of the twelve-hynde and twy-hynde division of
classes that unless further light can be let into it a
good deal of what we should like to see clearly must
remain unhappily enveloped in fog.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hides
were
family
holdings.
The
<i>familia</i>
of Bede.</div>

<p>Archbishop Egbert’s substitution of the phrase so
many <i>tributarii</i> or <i>manentes</i> for the ‘so many hides’
of the Laws of Ine obliges us to regard the <i>hide</i> of
Ine’s Dooms in this connection as equivalent to the
‘familia’ of Bede. The Saxon translator of the Latin
text of Bede translated the word <i>familia</i> sometimes
by ‘hide’ and sometimes by <i>hiwisc</i> or family. In this
connection it is also worth noting that, although
writing a century later than Egbert and two centuries
after the date of Ine’s Laws, the translator of Bede had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
not cast off all traces of tribal tradition, for he consistently
used the word <i>mægthe</i> as the equivalent of
Bede’s ‘provincia.’ He still thought of tribes and
peoples rather than of districts and provinces. His
ideas in these things ran on tribal rather than on
territorial lines. So to him the hide was still the
<i>family</i> unit, and the greater kindred or tribe, as in
Beowulf, was the <i>mægthe</i>. In Beowulf we saw that
some of them conquered others and made them pay
tribute. So they did in Bede’s time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Manentes</i>
and <i>tributarii</i>
of
Egbert.</div>

<p>While, then, we are obliged to connect the value
of oaths reckoned as of so many hides with hides
which were family holdings, or, as Egbert calls
them, <i>manentes</i> and <i>tributarii</i>, the original meaning
of the connection must be sought for in tribal conceptions.</p>

<p>It seems to be quite clear that in saying that the
twelve-hyndeman’s oath was an oath of 120 hides,
and the ceorl’s presumably of 20 hides, we have not
yet necessarily struck the real train of thought
underlying the connection between oaths and hides.
For it is absurd to think that the twelve-hyndeman
could pretend to the occupation or possession of 120
hides or family holdings, or the ceorl to 20 hides.
They could do no such thing. The ceorl, in later
times at all events, who had the twy-hynde wergeld
was ‘the ceorl who sits on gafol land’&mdash;a gafol-gelda
on some one else’s land. And to the great-grandson
of the ceorl who had risen to five hides, the continued
possession of five hides was sufficient to qualify
him for a <i>sithcund</i> status worth a wergeld of 1200
shillings or 2000 <i>thrymsas</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>The question, therefore, needs closer examination
if we would rightly understand the meaning underlying
the distinction between the twy-hynde and
twelve-hynde social status.</p>

<p>Let us then in the first place try to understand
the meaning of the word <i>hynde</i> which gives to the
distinction between twy-hynde and twelve-hynde
its important significance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
meaning
of ‘hynden.’</div>

<p>The word separated from its prefix apparently
occurs in only two places in the Laws. It occurs for
the first time in an important clause of the Laws of
Ine. And once more it occurs in the Laws of Athelstan,
in the ‘Judicia Civitatis Londoniæ.’ A word
which occurs again in Anglo-Saxon laws after an
interval of more than two centuries may and perhaps
must have had a well-known original significance as
a legal term though found nowhere else in Anglo-Saxon
literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The set
of oath-helpers.</div>

<p>In Ine s. 54 the word is used twice. The first
part of the clause, which has already been quoted, is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(54) He who is charged with werfæhthe [man-slaying] and is
willing to deny the slaying on oath, then shall there be <i>in the
hynden</i> one King’s oath of xxx hides as well for a gesithcund man
as for a ceorlisc man whichsoever it may be.</p>

</div>

<p>In this first mention of the <i>hynden</i> the word must
mean the set of oath-helpers supporting their kinsman
with their oaths, and the clause lays down the rule
that in every such set of oath-helpers in the case of
‘slaying’ there must be a ‘King’s oath of thirty
hides.’ But what is this King’s oath of thirty hides
which is to be in the <i>hynden</i> of oath-helpers of both
the twy-hynde and twelve-hynde man in case of man-slaying?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The 30
hides oath
of the
King’s
thane.</div>

<p>In the Compact between Alfred and Guthrum is
a clause, already quoted, immediately following the
statement of the wergelds of Dane and English, and
the declaration that they were to be ‘equally dear,’
which seems to be almost a repetition of the clause
in Ine’s Laws, but without using the word <i>hynden</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(3) If a King’s thane be charged with man-slaying, if he means
to clear himself by oath, let him do it with twelve King’s thanes,
and if a lesser man than a King’s thane be charged, let him clear
himself with eleven of his like and with one <i>King’s thane</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>We have seen that the King’s thane is mentioned
in the Laws of Ine (s. 45), and that his social position
was much higher than that of the ordinary <i>gesithcundman</i>.
The bot for his <i>burg-bryce</i> was sixty scillings&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
halfway between that of the ealdorman at
eighty scillings and that of the gesithcundman having
land at thirty-five scillings.</p>

<p>The King’s thane’s oath seems, then, to be what is
meant by the King’s oath of thirty hides in the Laws
of Ine. But the King’s thane’s oath of thirty hides
being the oath of a class higher than that of the
gesithcundman, how is it that the oath of the latter
could be a 120 hide oath?&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> worth four times as
much as that of his superior, the King’s thane.</p>

<p>At first the two statements seem to clash, but on
reflection a spark of light seems to come from the
collision. The King’s thane’s oath in this case is
only <i>one oath in the hynden of twelve</i> oath-helpers
supporting the twelve-hynde or twy-hynde man.
When a King’s thane was himself charged with man-slaying
the later law declares that he must clear
himself with twelve King’s thane’s oaths. The full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
oath of the whole hynden, himself and his co-swearers,
would therefore be equivalent to an oath of 360 hides&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
worth three times the 120 hide oath of&mdash;may
we not now say?&mdash;the twelve oath-helpers forming
the <i>hynden</i> of the gesithcundman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The single
oath of
the
twelve-hyndeman
was of 10
hides.</div>

<p>The King’s thane’s official position was sufficient
to justify the threefold value of his oath and that of
the several oaths of his hynden. And if the 120 hide
oath of the twelve-hyndeman be the full oath of
himself and his hynden of oath-helpers, then his single
oath would be a ten hide oath, which is much more
within reason. The analogy would be complete were
it not for the necessity of including in the hynden of
the gesithcundman a King’s thane’s oath of thirty
hides; but this may have been an afterthought. The
mention of it in the law of Ine is in itself presumptive
evidence that it was a new and an additional
requirement beyond what Wessex custom had originally
required.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The oath
of himself
and oath-helpers
was of 120
hides.</div>

<p>So far, then, it seems to be pretty clear that the
120 hide oath of the twelve-hyndeman was the twelvefold
oath of himself and his hynden of oath-helpers,
each of whose single oaths was, like his own, a ten
hide oath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The oath-helpers
were kinsmen.</div>

<p>Adhering, then, to the meaning of <i>hynden</i> as the set
of oath-helpers, we have next to keep in mind that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
oath-helpers were naturally kinsmen representing the
slayer’s kindred and their responsibility for the wergeld
of the person slain if their kinsman was the slayer,
and by this consideration we are once more thrown
back upon tribal custom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The twy-hyndeman
and leysing’s
want
of kindred.</div>

<p>And when in the Compact between Alfred and
Guthrum we see the ‘ceorl who sits on gafol-land’
put in the same position as the Norse ‘leysing’ or
newly made freeman whose kindred was imperfect,
howbeit in course of being widened by each generation,
we seem again to be put upon the scent that
the twy-hynde condition of the Saxon ceorl may
also originally have had something to do with his imperfect
kindred.</p>

<p>When further, in the remarkable fragment already
quoted, we see the Saxon ceorl himself rising in the
social scale, getting land ‘to the King’s utware,’
having a ‘coat of mail, helmet, and over-gilded sword’
and doing direct service to the King, until at last,
his son’s son having had that land in succession,
the great-grandchildren become of <i>sithcund</i> kin with
twelve-hynde wergelds, the scent seems to lie all
the more strongly in the direction of the tribal rules
of kindred. For it is as though we had watched
the process of the growth of kindred in this case
till the <i>sithcund</i> condition was reached, and the full
hynden had been produced, thus raising the twy-hynde
into a twelve-hynde man.</p>

<p>The leysing, we learned from the Norse laws, being
a newly made freedman, had at first no freeborn kin
from whom he could inherit or who could inherit
from him. He had no one of his kin to swear for
him or to fight for him till he had sons and grandsons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
For three generations the descendants were
leysings still. And though during that time kinsmen
enough may have grown up around them to swear for
them yet still their oaths may well have been reckoned
of lower value than those of the hauld, each of whose
oath-helpers had a full kindred behind him to support
him. It took another three generations to put the
leysing in this position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The full
oath of a
man with
12 oath-helpers
of full
kindred
twelve-hynde.</div>

<p>There may, then, perhaps be involved in this
matter of imperfect and perfect kindred a principle of
tribal custom originally underlying the terms twelve-hynde
and twy-hynde. The oath of full value under
tribal usage would be the oath of a man with a
full kindred, <i>i.e.</i> with twelve hyndens, each of full
kindred, behind him. Only with a full kindred to
support him was his protection complete, because
without it he could not secure a full oath of twelve
sufficiently influential and powerful oath-helpers. If
he could claim from his kindred such an oath, then he
may well have been considered properly a twelve-hyndeman,
because such an oath meant practically
that he had the support and protection of twelve
hyndens of kinsmen in case of need.</p>

<p>This might at first sight seem an unnecessarily
large requirement if the <i>oath</i> were regarded only as
clearing a man from the charge of man-slaying. But
going back to tribal usage it seems no longer too
large when the alternative is considered. The
alternative was the ordeal and, on failure of the test
of innocence, the feud or the payment of a wergeld
of, as we have seen, normally one hundred head of
cattle. In either case the slayer was powerless if
alone. He was powerful only in having a full kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
behind him bound by ties of kinship and tribal usage
first to swear for him instead of his being put to the
ordeal, and secondly to fight for him or to assist him
in finding the hundred head of cattle required to buy
off the feud, according to the proverb ‘Buy off the
spear or bear it.’ In either case the completeness of
his kindred was the measure of the power of protection
behind him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The oath
of the
ceorl
worth
only one
sixth of
that of
the
twelve-hyndeman
and thus
only twy-hynde.</div>

<p>The twy-hyndeman considered as the leysing or
freedman would not be in this strong position. His
social status, resulting from his imperfect kindred,
must be a low one. If he slew a twelve-hyndeman,
from the point of view of the feud he would be
helpless. The kindred of the twelve-hyndeman slain
by him could not be satisfied merely by the slaughter
of an inferior. Tribal custom of the Continental
Saxons allowed vengeance for homicide by a thrall
to be taken upon seven thralls. Under Mercian
usage, as we have seen, it had been settled that the
oath of the ceorl was to be taken as worth one sixth
of that of the twelve-hyndeman, because the life of
six ceorls was held to be equivalent in the matter of
vengeance to that of one twelve-hyndeman. And
thus it may be that, in the case of man-slaying, his
oath and that of his oath-helpers, all of inferior value,
came, under Anglo-Saxon custom, to be reckoned in
comparison with that of the man of full kindred as
worth only ‘two hyndens’ as against his twelve.</p>

<p>In the other passage in which the word ‘hynden’
occurs it has not so distinctly the meaning of ‘oath-helpers.’
It is not used in relation to homicide or
wergelds, but still its use and its meaning are instructive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
hynden-men
of
the city
frith-gegildas.</div>

<p>The use of the word in the ‘Judicia Civitatis
Lundoniæ’<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> is in connection with the organisation of
‘frith-gegildas’ for the prevention and punishment
of theft. These ‘frith-gegildas’ were groups or
‘hyndens’ with a common purse. And contributions
were to be made for the common benefit. In the
eighth clause it was enacted that the hynden-men
should be collected every month, each twelve to a
common meal. ‘And if it should then happen that
any kin be so strong and so great within land or
without land whether xii-hynde or twy-hynde that
they refuse us our right and stand up in defence of a
thief, that we all of us ride thereto with the reeve
within whose “manung” it may be.’</p>

<p>These hyndens were not directly groups of
kinsmen and oath-helpers, but they were artificial
groups formed and bound by a pledge for mutual
protection, and the use of the word ‘hynden’ in this
sense is significant. There were hyndens of oath-helpers
under tribal custom, and now in the city
hyndens of frith-gegildas were formed for mutual
defence against powerful kindreds outside their city
who were in the habit of protecting thieves from justice.</p>

<p>This was the way apparently that a substitute was
found in the towns for the absent kindreds. And as
time went on these artificial hyndens of <i>gegildas</i> or
<i>congildones</i> no doubt in some measure took the place
of the hyndens of kinsmen in cases of homicide as
well as in cases of theft.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wealth
and fullness

<p>Naturally in the course of time the possession of
property and social status would gradually take the
place of the completeness of kindred, and the two
elements in status would easily be associated together
in common estimation. The value of a man’s oath
would depend more and more on the number of hides
of land he was reckoned to possess, or for which he
was responsible to the ‘King’s utware.’</p>

<p>If we may follow Schmid’s translation of ‘utware’
as ‘Heerbann’ and picture to ourselves the ceorl
who had risen to the social position of a man with a
kindred and having five hides to the King’s gafol,
with his coat of mail and helmet and over-gilded sword
coming up at the call of the King to the fyrd with
so many followers, whether kinsmen or tenants, from
the five hides under his charge and so becoming
‘gesithcund’ in regard to the King’s service, then
there would be force in the further clause which
declares that, although he had acquired a kindred
and a coat of mail and helmet and over-gilded sword,
yet <i>if he have not that land, he is still but a ceorl</i>.</p>

<p>The power and strength and status of a person
would still depend upon the combination of the two
elements, and both would have to be reckoned with.
A passage has already been quoted in which the
possibility is admitted of a kindred becoming so
powerful&mdash;<i>magna et fortis</i>&mdash;as to defy the King’s
law and defend the thief.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> There is another passage
relating to breaches of the peace in Kent in which
the two sources of this power of defiance are mentioned
together. The dangerous person may either
be <i>so rich</i> or be of <i>so great a kindred</i> that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
not be punished&mdash;‘adeo dives vel tantæ parentelæ ut
castigari non possit.’<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<h3>VI. THE GESITHCUND AND CEORLISC CLASSES IN THEIR
CONNECTION WITH LAND.</h3>

<p>Pursuing the question of division of classes mentioned
in the Dooms of Ine we turn now to the
consideration of the most prominent distinction which
runs through the clauses of the Dooms, viz. that of
<i>gesithcund</i> and <i>ceorlisc</i>.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the two distinctions may have
been gradually coming more and more to mean much
the same thing. As a rule no doubt in King Ine’s
time ceorlisc men were twy-hynde and gesithcund
men twelve-hynde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The unit
of 10 hides
of land.</div>

<p>The same class which, regarded from the point of
view of the wergeld, possessed completeness of
kindred and the twelve-hynde oath, when looked at
from another point of view was gesithcund, <i>i.e.</i> more
or less directly in the service of the King and belonging
to the official and landed class. So that the
value of the oath of both twelve-hynde and gesithcund
men may have become easily associated with a
territorial unit of ten hides of land.</p>

<p>Now, the fact of the connection of the value of the
oath with ten hides of land is pretty good proof that
for practical purposes and in common usage the
holding of ten hides was looked upon as in some
way or other a typical unit of holding of the
gesithcund or landed class. There is nothing new in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
this suggestion, but its lack of novelty does not
detract from its value. And an examination from a
tribal point of view of the isolated passages in the
Dooms of Ine relating to this typical holding of ten
hides may possibly throw further and useful light
upon the position of the gesithcund class.</p>

<p>While we speak of the gesithcund class as
almost equivalent to the landed class it is obvious
that it would be wrong to consider every gesithcundman
as a landowner. Attention has already been
called to the following clause:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(51) If a gesithcundman owning land neglect the fyrd, let him
pay 120<i>s.</i> and forfeit his land. One not owning land 60<i>s.</i>, a
<i>ceorlisc</i> man 30<i>s.</i> as fyrd-wite.</p>

</div>

<p>The gesithcundman <i>not</i> possessing land may either
be one who has forfeited his land or a cadet of the
class not having yet attained to the position of
landholding and yet being gesithcund by birth.</p>

<p>Nor would it do to let modern notions of landownership
intrude themselves so far into the question
as to make us regard the gesithcund and landed
class as a class of land-<i>owners</i> in the modern sense.
If the typical holding of ten hides be that of the
gesithcundman, we may have to regard him rather
as a gesith of the King put into possession of the ten
hides by way of stewardship than as anything like
the absolute owner of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ten hides
the unit
for food
rents to
the chieftain
or
King.</div>

<p>The typical holding of ten hides may perhaps be
usefully regarded, from a fiscal point of view, as a
unit for purposes of revenue, at a time when that
revenue under tribal custom consisted chiefly of food
rents paid in kind for the King’s or the chieftain’s use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>Clause 70 of the Dooms of Ine fixes in detail the
food rent of ‘ten hides’ ‘to fostre’ or ‘on feorm.’</p>

<p>If the unit of ten hides were not the customary
unit for these food rents on the Royal domains why
should the details of the food rent of ten hides have
been made the subject of an isolated clause like
this?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Land
grants
of 10
hides.</div>

<p>Again, if we turn to the grants made by King Ine to
the monasteries, they become intelligible if the system
of management of the Royal domains in units and
multiples of ten hides may be understood to underlie
them. When Ine grants to Aldhelm, then Abbot of
Malmesbury, ‘45 cassati’ in the county of Wilts, the
grant is found to consist of groups of ‘manentes’ in
four different places. And the groups consist of 5,
20, 10, and 10.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> When Ine makes a grant to Abbot
Bernald of land in Somersetshire it consists of three
groups of 20, 20, and 20 <i>cassati</i> or <i>manentes</i> from three
different estates.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> And when he makes a similar
grant to Glastonbury it consists of 10, 10, 20, 20 hides
and one hide in five different places in Somersetshire.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>So also when Bede mentions the donations by King
Oswy to the Abbess Hilda of 12 <i>possessiuncula
terrarum</i> he adds that six were in the province of
Deira and six in Bernicia and that each of them
consisted of 10 <i>familiæ</i>, so that in all there were 120.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>Now it would seem that as ealdormen were set
over shires so gesithcund men may have been set
over smaller units of 10 hides or multiples of 10
hides, holding them as lænland, not only for services
rendered, but also with some kind of subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
official or even judicial functions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Official
position
of the
gesithcundman.</div>

<p>Schmid long ago pointed out that the translator
of Bede in six passages translated the Latin <i>comes</i> by
‘gesith’ or ‘gesithcundman.’<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> This seems to imply
that his position was in some sense an official one,
subordinate indeed to the ealdorman’s, as we may also
learn from the translator of Bede. For while he
translates the ‘<i>villa comitis</i>’ of Bede as the ‘<i>gesith’s
hus</i>’ he translates the ‘<i>villa regis</i>’ as the residence of
the king’s ealdor (‘botl cyninges ealdor’).<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>We found in s. 45 of King Ine’s Laws above quoted
that the gesithcundman’s burg-bryce was thirty-five
scillings while the ealdorman’s was eighty scillings.
Still, though the lowest official in the scale, it was
something that he should be named with the King, the
ealdorman, and the King’s thane as having a burg-bryce
according to which he was to make legal
denial (ansacan).</p>

<p>The omission from this clause as to burg-bryce of
classes below him seems to mark that while even the
ceorlisc man&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> even the gafol-gelda or gebur&mdash;was
responsible for the peace within his ‘flet’ and received
a fight-wite when it was broken by fighting in it, the
gesithcundman belonged to the class with some sort of
extra jurisdiction beyond that which attached to every
man whose homestead was by long tribal custom a
sacred precinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His judicial
and
magisterial
duties.</div>

<p>And there is a clause in the Laws of Ine which
seems to refer to the something like judicial duties
of the gesithcundman, for it shows that neglect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
them causing a suit which he ought to have settled to
be carried to a higher court&mdash;before the ealdorman or
the King&mdash;deprived him of his right to share in the
‘wite-ræden,’ whatever they were, appertaining to the
suit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif gesiðcund mon þingað wið

he would not correct him
before of his evil deeds at home.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>That he had special duties to discharge in connection
with the ‘fyrd’ was shown not only by one of
the qualifications of the gesithcund status being the
possession of a coat of mail, helmet, and over-gilded
sword, but also by the fyrd-wite of 120 scillings and
the loss of his land, if he neglected the fyrd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His duty

<p>That he was put into his landed position under
conditions to secure the management of the land for
the provision of the King’s gafol is shown by the
following clauses, which in regard to one important
particular at least point out what was expected of
him and further suggest that there was reason to fear
that sometimes he might be inclined to desert his
post without having performed the conditions upon
which his land was held.</p>

<p>These clauses suggest very clearly that the gesithcundman

the special obligation to provide the food rent by
settling tenants upon the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Method of

<p>Let us pass, then, to what evidence the Dooms of
Ine afford as to the customary method of settling
tenants on the land.</p>

<p>The very next sections to those just quoted are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

and let him give up (?) the acres.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The yardland
was
the usual
holding
of the
<i>gebur</i>,
with a
pair of
oxen.</div>

<p>Working from the known to the unknown, in a
former volume we found that under the open-field
system of husbandry the hide at the time of the
Domesday survey and earlier was generally held to
contain four virgates or yardlands, and that so far
as arable land was concerned each yardland was a
bundle, so to speak, of about thirty scattered strips
or acres. Tracing the yardland further back, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
interesting point was gained from the tenth-century
document known as the ‘Rectitudines &amp;c.,’ that ‘in
some regions’ the custom in allotting a yardland to
a tenant called a ‘<i>gebur</i>’ was to give him with his
yardland to <i>land-setene</i> seven acres already sown and
a <i>pair of oxen</i>, and certain other things theoretically
by way of loan, so that on the gebur’s death everything
returned to the lord, though in practice the holding
and land-setene were no doubt continued to his successor
on payment of a ‘relief.’ And this system of
settling gafol-geldas and geburs, or whatever such
tenants might be locally called, on yardlands seems to
be that alluded to in the Dooms of Ine. The clauses
incidentally referring to gafol-geldas, geburs, and yardlands
thus become intelligible and important in the
light of the later evidence. This I endeavoured to
show in a former volume.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The hide
of four
yardlands
agricultural.</div>

<p>Now, this system of settling tenants on yardlands
by allotting to each a pair of oxen, so that four of them
should be able to combine in forming the common
plough-team of the hide, obviously belongs to a time
when agriculture had become sufficiently important
for the unit of occupation and so of gafol-paying and
services to be generally agricultural rather than pastoral.
But while the <i>hide</i> thus seems to have been
connected in the Dooms of Ine mainly with arable
farming, it does not follow that it always had been so
everywhere. The word ‘hide’ may have originally
been applied to a holding devoted more to the
grazing of cattle than the growing of corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>The remarkable document which has been called
‘The Tribal Hidage,’ to the meaning and date of which
Mr. W. J. Corbett<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> has opened our eyes, shows that
forty or fifty years before the date of the Dooms of
Ine the whole of England then subject to the Anglo-Saxons
was, as we should say, rated in hides according
to its tribes or mægthes, possibly for the fiscal
purposes of the Bretwaldaship. And it would
seem likely that under the common designation of
hides pastoral as well as agricultural units for food
rents must have been included. This seems to be
indicated by the fact that the hides and virgates of
the pastoral districts of West Wales in the Exon
Domesday book are many times greater than those
of other parts of England, and vary very much in
area.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In pastoral
districts
co-aration
of the
waste.</div>

<p>In the pastoral or grazing districts recently conquered
from West Wales early tribal usage would be
very likely to survive. And there may well have
been some continuity in the methods of tribal agriculture.
Judging from what we know from the
Cymric Codes, there might not yet be permanent
division of the fields into strips and virgates but
rather co-aration of such portions of the waste
each year as suited the requirements of the tribesmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The team
of 8 oxen
said not
to be
German.</div>

<p>The open-field system of agriculture was in its
main principles and chief methods common to German
and Celtic tribes. But we are told that the Germans
knew nothing of co-operative ploughing and the
team of eight oxen on which the agricultural hidage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of England was so clearly based. For the team of
eight oxen we must go to the Cymric Codes and the
practice in the Isle of Man and Scotland. It was
common to these Celtic regions, even to its details&mdash;the
yoke of four oxen abreast and the driver walking
backwards in front of the team.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> In such a matter
as the method of ploughing there may well have been
continuity.</p>

<p>We seem to see in the Laws of Ine the process
going on of transition from the tribal form of the
open-field system&mdash;the co-aration of the waste&mdash;to
the more fixed forms of settled and permanent agriculture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The allotment
of
stock and
homestead
by
the lord to
the gebur
was the
basis of
the
tenancy.</div>

<p>Thus, without pressing analogies too far, there
may be a root of tribal custom discernible even in the
system of settling geburs on yardlands. Something
very much like it was followed on the Continent
under Roman usage. But the case of the veteran to
whom a pair of oxen with seed of two kinds was
given as his outfit only partly resembled the case of
the gebur. In the case of the gebur the outfit of
oxen remained in theory the property of the lord,
and returned to him on the death of the tenant.
This was the essential point which created the
semi-servile tenancy. With the homestead went the
‘setene’ or outfit and the corresponding obligation
not only of gafol but also of week-work, and out of
the peculiar relation so established may have grown
up in West Wales, as in Wales itself and Ireland,
very easily the doctrine that after its continuance
for four generations the tenant became <i>adscriptus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
glebæ</i>.</p>

<p>The allotment of stock by the Irish chieftain
formed, as we have seen, in a cattle-breeding rather
than an agricultural community the traditional tie
between himself and his tenants, whether tribesmen
or strangers. The Cymric chieftain of a kindred
followed very nearly the same traditional practice
when he gave to the young tribesman on his attaining
the age of fourteen his <i>da</i> (or allotment of
cattle) for his maintenance, thereby establishing
the relation of ‘man and kin’ between him and the
chief.</p>

<p>The same tribal principles were, moreover, applied
to strangers both in Ireland and Wales. The Irish
‘fuidhir’ thus settled on the chieftain’s land became,
as we have seen, after four generations <i>adscriptus
glebæ</i>, and so did the <i>Aillt</i> or <i>Alltud</i> settled on the
Cymric chieftain’s land. And the same number of
generations attached the <i>nativus</i> to the land under
early Scotch law.</p>

<p>Now, if under tribal usage this was so, it need not
be surprising that in the newly conquered districts of
West Wales or more generally in Wessex at the time
of King Ine, when the extension of agriculture was
an immediate necessity, something like the same
traditional system should continue or come again
naturally into use, producing something like the same
kind of dependence of one class upon the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This
system
of settlement
very
general.</div>

<p>It is necessary to point out that this method of
settling tenants on yardlands with an outfit of a pair
of oxen &amp;c. was more or less general, because doubts
have been recently thrown upon it. Its prevalence
as a custom does not rest entirely on the evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the ‘Rectitudines’ but on several incidental mentions
of it in various and distant quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kent.</div>

<p>For instance, in the will of a reeve named Abba
of Kent (about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 833)<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> is the gift of a ‘half
swulung’&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> what elsewhere would have been
described as a half hide&mdash;and with that land were to
go four oxen, two cows, and fifty sheep, that is two
oxen and one cow and twenty-five sheep to each <i>gioc</i>
or yardland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Glastonbury.</div>

<p>And again, the Inquisition of Glastonbury (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
1189)<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> describes the holder of a yardland almost in
the same terms as those used in the ‘Rectitudines’
in the description of the <i>gebur</i>. He is said to hold
a yardland for 32<i>d.</i> (probably 1<i>d.</i> per acre), and
every Monday he must plough a half-acre and harrow
it, and he works every day in the week but on
Sunday. He has from his lord one heifer (<i>averum</i>)
and two oxen and one cow and seven acres of corn
sown and three acres of oats (to start with)&mdash;ten
acres in all sown&mdash;and six sheep and one ram.
King Ine made grants of land, as we have seen,
to Glastonbury, and it is interesting to find the
custom of allowing two oxen, one cow, and six sheep
to the yardland as described in the ‘Rectitudines’
still going on in West Wales five hundred years after
Ine’s time on the estates of the Abbey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Winchester.</div>

<p>Take again the charter MLXXIX. mentioned by
Kemble (i. p. 216). This charter shows that the
Bishop of Winchester (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 902) had leased fifteen hides
of land to a relative of the Bishop, requiring that he
must settle there (<i>inberthan</i>)<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> men who would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
fixed (<i>hamettan</i>) to the place. He himself had
‘hamet’ Lufe and her three bairns, and Luhan and
his six bairns, and these must remain on the land
whoever might hold it. There were also three
<i>witetheows</i> <i>bur</i>bærde and three more <i>theow</i>bærde
belonging to the Bishop, with their descendants
(<i>and hire team</i>). At this date the settling of new
tenants (may we not say?) some of them as geburs
and some as theows was still going on in Wessex

<p>It is quite true that the holders of these yardlands
are not everywhere always described as <i>geburs</i>. But
we are dealing with the <i>thing</i>, not the name. The
word <i>gebur</i>, however, was of much wider use than
merely in one or two localities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tyddenham.</div>

<p>It is not only in the ‘Rectitudines’ that the
gebur and his services are mentioned. On the
Tyddenham Manor of King Edwy on the ‘geset-land’
there were ‘geburs’ with yardlands (gyrdagafollandes)&mdash;as
mentioned in the former volume
(p. 150). And other examples may be quoted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shaftesbury. Hatfield.</div>

<p>In the will of Wynfled<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> there is mention of lands
at Shaftesbury and ‘the geburs that on those gafollands
sit’ (<i>þara gebura di on þam gafollandes sittað</i>).
And as incidental evidence that the geburs became
in course of time <i>adscripti glebæ</i>, it is worth while to
remember that early in the eleventh century the
monks of Ely in connection with their Manor of
Hatfield kept record of the children of the geburs on
their estate who had married with others of neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
manors, so that they might not lose sight
of them and their rights over them. And the
importance with which their rights were regarded
is emphasised by the fact that the record was
kept upon the back of an ancient copy of the
Gospels belonging presumably to the altar of St.
Etheldreda.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Now, if such in part was the relation between the
gesithcundman and the tenants of the yardlands of
his ‘geset-land’ arising from the allotment or loan
of stock, may not something of the same kind lie at
the root of the relation between the gesithcundman
himself and the King? Lord as he may have been
over his ceorlisc gafol-geldas, was not the gesithcundman
himself a servant of the King looking after
the King’s gafol, a kind of middleman, tied to his
post with the ealdorman above him in the hierarchy
of Royal service, liable to lose his land if he neglected
his duty?</p>

<div class="sidenote">How far
the gebur
was <i>adscriptus
glebæ</i>.</div>

<p>It is an interesting question how far the ceorlisc
class were <i>adscripti glebæ</i> under the Laws of Ine,
but when we try to find this out we discover that
both classes seem to be under some kind of restraint
as to ‘going away’ (<i>fære</i>). If a gesithcundman
‘fare’ we have seen under what restrictions it must
be. There is another clause which deals with the
case of persons who shall ‘fare’ without leave from
their lords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

lord without leave or steal himself
away into another shire and
he be discovered, let him go where
he was before and pay to his lord
60 scillings.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Judged in the light of later laws to the same
or nearly similar effect, this clause must probably be
regarded rather as early evidence of the relation
between lord and man established generally for the
maintenance of the public peace, than as bearing
directly upon the question of the attachment of the
smaller class of tenants to the soil.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> And yet if the
relation of the ordinary freeman to, let us say, the
ealdorman of the shire was such that he might not
move into another shire without leave, and until it
was ascertained whether his action was <i>bona fide</i>, or
perhaps with the object to escape from debt or
vengeance for a wrong committed, the restriction
would be likely to be still stronger when a tenant
was under fixed obligations to his lord, or had, by
taking a yardland and homestead, settled on his
lord’s land and accepted stock under conditions of
gafol and week-work regulated by general usage.</p>

<p>The idea of freedom as a kind of masterful independence
of the individual was not one inherited
from tribal modes of thought, nor likely to be fostered
by the circumstances of the times which followed
upon the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britain. When
this fact is fully recognised, the gulf between the
gesithcund and ceorlisc classes does not seem so deep,
after all, as it would be if, instead of approaching the
question from a tribal point of view, we were looking
for allodial landowners on the one hand and expecting
the ceorl to be a member of a village community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
of independent peasant proprietors on the other
hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king’s
food rents
or gafol
how paid.</div>

<p>But we are not doing this, and, returning to the
gesithcundman, perhaps we have after all taken
for granted quite enough that the general environment
in Wessex was agricultural rather than pastoral.
Even as regards King Ine himself, there may have
been a good deal of the tribal chieftain still left
in his relations to his gesithcund followers and
officials. We have spoken of his tribal food rents;
but how did he gather them?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>firma
unius
noctis</i>.</div>

<p>No doubt the King’s gafol may partly have been
paid in money. But so far as it was paid in kind
it must have been carried by his tenants to his
Winchester palace, or one of his other manors,
according to the system prevalent at the time,
followed for centuries after in West Wales, viz. the
system of the ‘night’s entertainment’ (<i>firma unius
noctis</i>)&mdash;a system followed by tribal chieftains and
their Royal successors in Scandinavia as well as in
Britain.</p>

<p>When the Domesday survey was made of what
was once West Wales there was found still existing,
especially in Dorsetshire, the survival of a very
practical arrangement of Royal food rents which may
have been in use in King Ine’s time and date back
possibly before the West Saxon conquests.</p>

<p>Some portions of the ‘terra Regis’ scattered about
the county of Dorset are grouped in the survey so
that each group might supply the <i>firma unius noctis</i>,
the money equivalent of which is stated to be 104<i>l.</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> 2<i>l.</i> per night’s entertainment for one night each
week in the year. This mode of providing the <i>firma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
unius noctis</i> is illustrated by the legend which represents
King Ine himself and his queen as moving from
manor to manor for each night’s entertainment, their
moveable palace of poles and curtains being carried
before them from place to place upon sumpter
mules.</p>

<p>Now, if we might regard the gesithcundman as
one of a class to whom ten hides or twenty hides had
been allotted by King Ine on a system providing in
this practical way <i>inter alia</i> for the night’s entertainments,
it would be natural that the food rent of the
unit of ten hides should be fixed. And further, it
would be natural that if the gesithcundman should
wish to throw up his post and desert the land entrusted
to his management he should be restricted,
as we have seen, by conditions intended to secure
that the provision for the King’s entertainment or
gafol in lieu of it should not materially suffer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
gesithcundman
sometimes
evicted.</div>

<p>We have seen that as the ealdorman was to lose
his ‘shire’ if he let go a thief, so the gesithcundman
was to pay a fyrdwite, and to lose his <i>land</i> if he
neglected the <i>fyrd</i>. It was possible, then, that he
might have to be evicted. And a clause in the
Dooms of Ine has already been quoted which seems
to refer to the eviction of a gesithcundman.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Be gesiðcundes monnes dræfe
of londe.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(68) If a gesithcundman be
driven off land.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif mon gesiðcundne monnan

<p class="lang2of2">If one drive off a gesithcundman,

</div>

</div>

<p>If he was evicted he was to be driven from the <i>botl</i>
or homestead, not the <i>setene</i>. What can the <i>setene</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
have been?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Were the
stock and
crops
always
his own?</div>

<p>The land granted or intrusted to the gesithcundman
for the performance of corresponding duties is
not likely to have been mere waste. Part of it
might surely already be ‘geset land,’ let to tenants
of yardlands. On the rest of it still held in demesne
there would probably be some herds of cattle. In
these early days the cattle and corn on the land
were far more valuable than the mere land itself.
If, therefore, a fixed food rent was payable to the
King, may it not be inferred that sometimes the
typical holding of ten hides included the stock let
with it, just as, according to the ‘Rectitudines,’ the
yardland did? Following strictly the analogy, the
original stock on the land and in the hands of the
tenants would be the ‘setene’ of the gesithcundman,
theoretically, like the land itself, belonging, not to
him, but to his lord? It might have been sometimes
so. But at the same time there might be
other cases in which the possession of cattle may
have led to the tenure. The ceorl or the wealh who
had risen to having five hides may have brought
the cattle or setene with him. And to evict him
from his own cattle and crops as well as from the <i>botl</i>
might be unjust.</p>

<p>The text as it stands seems to mean that the
gesithcundman is not to be evicted <i>from</i> the <i>setene</i>,
and the clause seems to be intended to protect his
rights and to prevent his being evicted from his own
stock and crops on the land. The clause is not
clear, but it adds to the sense that in the case of
the gesithcundman we are not dealing with a landowner
who can do what he likes with his own, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
more than in the case of the ceorlisc gafol-geldas we
are dealing with a class of peasant proprietors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position
of the two
classes
in Ine’s
time.</div>

<p>Difficult as it may be to come to a clear understanding
of some of these isolated passages in the
Dooms of Ine, they may at least have saved us from
the pitfall of a fatal anachronism. Their difficulties,
forcing us to think, may in some degree have helped
us to realise the point of view from which the two
classes&mdash;gesithcund and ceorlisc&mdash;were regarded in
early Wessex legislation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
gesithcund
class
the landed
class.
The
ceorlisc
class the
tenant
class paying
gafol
to the
landed
class.</div>

<p>Throughout Wessex, speaking generally, they
seem to have been regarded as the two prominent
classes in practical agricultural life. The general
facts of everyday observation marked off the gesithcundman
as belonging to the ruling class, holding
land direct from the King as the King’s gesith,
while the ceorlisc man, speaking generally, in
his relation to land was the gafol-gelda or gebur
sometimes probably holding his yardland on the
King’s demesne, but mostly perhaps and more and
more often as the tenant of the gesithcundman.
This, it would seem, had become so general that in
King Alfred’s day and perhaps even in King Ine’s,
ignoring the exceptional classes between the gesithcund
and the other class, there was no absurdity in
King Alfred’s claiming that equally dear with the
Danish lysing the ‘ceorl who sits on gafol land’
should have a twy-hynde wergeld.</p>

<p>The division into gesithcund and ceorlisc classes
was doubtless a somewhat rough and wide generalisation.
There were, we know, men without land who
belonged to the gesithcund class, and ceorls who
were not tenants of yardlands. And even among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
the tenants of yardlands some paid gafol only and
others both gafol and week-work. But for our purpose
the fact to be noted is that the generalisation
was sufficiently near the truth for it to be
made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
ceorlisc
class
would
include
newly
made
freedmen.</div>

<p>We must not infer that these two classes included
strictly the whole population. Judging from Continental
evidence, Wessex must have been very
exceptional indeed if there were not everywhere
numerous <i>theows</i> or thralls. From this class Anglo-Saxon
wills and other documents show that there
was a constant stream of freedmen or theows who by
emancipation were allowed to creep up into the
ceorlisc class, partly as the result of Christian
impulse, and partly probably from the lack of tenants
to occupy the yardlands left vacant by the desolation
caused by constant wars.</p>

<p>Thus while, broadly speaking, the gesithcund
and the ceorlisc classes may have corresponded to
the twelve-hynde and twy-hynde classes, they were not
absolutely identical. The two lines of distinction
had not the same origin and did not run absolutely
parallel. But they may well have worked in the
same direction. The original distinction founded
upon the possession or absence of the perfect kindred
and ‘hyndens of oath-helpers’ was rooted in tribal
instincts and never wholly extinguished throughout
Anglo-Saxon history. The gesithcund class, most
perfect in their kindred and nearest in their relation
to the King, influenced perhaps by traditions of
Roman land management, naturally grew up into
a twelve-hynde and landed class, while the ceorlisc
class, recruited from outside and from below, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
naturally became their tenants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The gulf
between
the two
classes
existed
in King
Alfred’s
time.</div>

<p>Thus in England, as elsewhere, we may easily believe
that the gulf between classes resulting from tribal
instincts and confirmed by difference in wergelds was
hardened and widened by the conditions of landholding
in the conquered country, which tended to raise the
one class more and more into manorial lords and depress
the other into more or less servile tenants. The
Compact between Alfred and Guthrum affords the
strongest evidence that already in King Alfred’s time
the process was far enough advanced for a pretty
hard line to be drawn between them.</p>

<h3>VII. COMPARISON OF WESSEX AND MERCIAN WERGELDS
WITH THOSE OF CONTINENTAL TRIBES.</h3>

<p>Before passing from the Wessex to the Kentish
laws it may be well to mark the position to which
the evidence hitherto examined has brought us with
regard to the amount of the wergelds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continental
wergelds
of
200 and
160 gold
solidi for
the full
freeman.</div>

<p>We have had again and again to come back to
the question of the status of the twelve-hynde and
twy-hynde classes as shown by their wergelds. By
the Compact between King Alfred and Guthrum the
English wergelds were brought into line with Norse
and other Continental wergelds. The statement of the
higher wergeld in gold made possible a comparison
of the Anglo-Saxon with Continental wergelds.</p>

<p>The result of the inquiry into the Continental
wergelds of the full freeman was that they seemed to
fall very distinctly into two classes&mdash;the Frankish
and Norse wergeld of 200 gold solidi, on the one
hand, and the Frisian, Saxon, Alamannic, Bavarian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
and possibly Burgundian wergeld of 160 gold solidi
on the other hand.</p>

<p>The ratio between these two wergelds is as 5:4.</p>

<p>Now, this is exactly the ratio between the two
twelve-hynde wergelds of the Anglo-Saxon laws, <i>i.e.</i>
of Wessex and of Mercia. Both were of 1200 scillings,
but the Wessex scilling was of five pence and
the Mercian of four pence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Wessex
and
Mercian
wergelds
ancient.</div>

<p>Finding twelve-hynde and twy-hynde wergelds in
the Laws of Ine, we seem to be bound to regard the
distinctions between the two classes as going back to
a time two centuries at least before the inroads of
the Northmen.</p>

<p>The position of the Dooms of Ine as they have
come down to us annexed to the Laws of King Alfred
might possibly have raised a doubt as to whether the
incidental mention of the wergelds might not have
been inserted in the text by the scribes of King
Alfred. But if the Mercian wergelds were of ancient
tradition, independently of the Wessex evidence, the
statement of the Wessex wergelds in the Dooms of
Ine need not be doubted. At the same time, the
amount of the Wessex wergeld is confirmed by the
wergeld of the secular thane in the Northumbrian
statement, for 2000 thrymsas are equal to 6000 pence,
and thus the wergeld of the thane accords with the
Wessex twelve-hyndeman’s wergeld. And as this
statement seems to have been rescued from times
anterior to the Northmen’s invasion, it is so far independent
evidence. In the same document the ceorl’s
wergeld of 200 Mercian scillings is also mentioned.</p>

<p>The concurrence of independent traditions thus
seems to trace back the difference between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
Wessex and Mercian wergelds as well as the difference
between the twelve-hynde and twy-hynde classes
in both cases into the early Anglo-Saxon period.
And if we may date them back to the time of King
Ine&mdash;two centuries before the invasion of the Northmen&mdash;they
may well go back earlier still. For
wergelds which have already become traditional in
the seventh century may not improbably have been
brought by the invading tribes with them into Britain
in the fifth and sixth centuries. The fact that the
Mercian and Wessex wergelds differed makes it unlikely
that the traditional wergelds were first adopted
in Britain or acquired from the Romano-British
population. That they differed exactly in the same
ratio as the two classes of Continental wergelds
differed is a fact which points still more strongly to
a Continental origin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At 1:10
Wessex
wergeld
of 6000
pence =
200 gold
solidi, and
the
Mercian
of 4800
pence =
160 gold
solidi.</div>

<p>Moreover, the Wessex and Northumbrian wergeld
of 1200 scillings of five pence&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> 6000 pence or
sceatts at a ratio of 1:10&mdash;was equal to 600 tremisses
or 200 gold solidi.</p>

<p>The Mercian wergeld of 1200 scillings of four
pence&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> 4800 pence or sceatts&mdash;at the same ratio
was equal to 480 tremisses or 160 gold solidi.</p>

<p>That the ratio of 1:10 was not an unlikely one
is shown by its being the ratio under the Lex Salica
between the forty scripula of silver and the gold solidus
before the Merovingian reduction of the standard
weight of the latter and the issue of silver tremisses.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
It was also the ratio at which twelve Roman argentei
or drachmæ of silver were apparently reckoned as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
equal to the Merovingian gold solidus.</p>

<p>The correspondence at this ratio of the Wessex
twelve-hynde wergeld with the Frankish wergeld of
200 gold solidi, and of the Mercian twelve-hynde
wergeld with the other Continental wergelds of 160
gold solidi, is sufficiently striking to be taken into
account in any speculation as to the respective origins
of the West Saxon and Mercian invading tribes. But
that is not the object of this essay. It is enough to
have noted a fact which may or may not turn out to
be of some historical significance.</p>

<p>The value of the wergelds to this inquiry consists
in the light they throw upon the solidarity of tribal
society and the position in social rank of the various
classes of Anglo-Saxon society. But we have yet to
examine the laws of the Kentish kings, and it will be
best to suspend any further judgment on these points
until this remaining part of our task has been done.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE LAWS OF THE KENTISH KINGS.</i></span></h2>

<h3>I. DISTINCTION FROM ANGLO-SAXON LAWS, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 596-696.</h3>

<p>The laws of the Kentish kings, if they had been on
all fours with the other Anglo-Saxon laws, would
have taken back the general evidence for Anglo-Saxon
custom another hundred years earlier than
the Laws of Ine, and nearer the time of the conquest
of Britain. As it is, however, they have to be treated
as in part exceptional.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Belgic
agriculture.</div>

<p>It is very probable that for a long period the
proximity of Kent to the Continent had resulted in
the approximation of its social and economic conditions
to those of the opposite shore of the Channel.
The south-east corner of Britain was described by
Cæsar as having been colonised by Belgæ and as having
been for some time under Belgic rule. The Belgic
tribes were the furthest advanced of Celtic tribes
and, according to Cæsar, had fostered agriculture,
while his informants spoke of the interior of Britain
as pastoral.</p>

<p>Under Roman rule the prominence of agriculture
was continued. Ammianus Marcellinus describes
large exports of British corn to supply Roman legions
on the Rhine. He speaks of the British <i>tributarii</i> in
a way which suggests that this part of Britain under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
Roman rule had become subject to economic arrangements
similar to those of the Belgic provinces of Gaul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sulungs
and
yokes of
Kent.</div>

<p>The introduction, by invitation, of the Jutes into
Kent and their settlement, in the first instance at all
events, under a friendly agreement of payment of
<i>annonæ</i>, may have given an exceptional character to
the results of ultimate conquest. The permanent
prominence of agriculture is perhaps shown by the
fiscal assessment in ‘sulungs’ and ‘yokes’ instead
of hides and virgates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early
clerical influences.</div>

<p>The exceptional conditions of the Kentish district
were continued by its being the earliest to come into
close contact with the court of the Merovingian
Franks, and with ecclesiastical influences from Rome.
The mission of St. Augustine resulted in the codification
of Kentish custom into written laws a century
earlier than the date of the earliest laws of Wessex.</p>

<p>The peculiar character of Kentish custom may
have been further maintained by the partial isolation
of Kent. The kingdom of the Kentish kings, though
lessened in Ethelbert’s time by the encroachment of
Wessex, had maintained its independence of both the
Northumbrian and Mercian supremacy or Bretwaldorship.</p>

<p>Apart from any original difference in custom
between Jutish and other tribes this isolation naturally
produced divergence in some respects from the
customs of the rest of Anglo-Saxon England and may
perhaps partly explain why the Laws of the Kentish
Kings came to be included in only one of the early
collections of Anglo-Saxon laws.</p>

<p>Further, when we approach the subject of Kentish
wergelds we do so with the direct warning, already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
alluded to, of the writer of the so-called Laws of
Henry I., that we shall find them differing greatly
from those of Wessex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds
said to
differ
from
those of
Wessex
and
Mercia.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This we have said according to our law and custom, but the
difference of wergeld is great in Kent, <i>villanorum et baronum</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Moreover, in after times Kentish custom differed
from that of other parts of England in the matter of
succession. The custom of Gavelkind prevailed in
Kent. And among the statutes after the Norman
Conquest there is an undated statement setting forth
peculiar customs of Kent in matters where they
differed from those of the rest of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Some of these differences may have been of later
origin, but a comparison of the laws themselves with
other Anglo-Saxon laws is conclusive upon the point
that important differences always existed and, what is
more, were recognised as existing.</p>

<p>Although the Kentish laws are not included
with other Anglo-Saxon laws in any manuscript but
that of Rochester, yet they were known to King Alfred.
He mentioned them in the proem to his laws as well
as the Mercian laws as among those which he had
before him in framing his own. Moreover, we have
seen that at the time of the Danish invasion certain
differences between the Kentish and other laws were
known and noted correctly in the fragment ‘Of
Grith and of Mund.’</p>

<p>Finally, in its system of monetary reckoning the
Kentish kingdom seems to have been peculiar from
the first. And as our knowledge of the Kentish
wergelds is essential to an understanding of the
division of classes, a good deal must depend upon
a previous understanding of the currency in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
the amounts of the wergelds are described. Before
proceeding further it is necessary, therefore, to devote
a section to a careful consideration of the subject.
The experience already gained will not be thrown
away if it should help us to understand the meaning
of the scætts and scillings of the Kentish laws.</p>

<h3>II. THE SCÆTTS AND SCILLINGS OF THE KENTISH LAWS.</h3>

<p>All the payments mentioned in the Kentish laws
are stated in scætts and scillings&mdash;naturally, by far
the larger number of them in the latter.</p>

<p>What were these scætts and scillings? First,
what were the scætts?<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The scætts
of 28·8
wheat-grains
like Merovingian
tremissis.</div>

<p>We have already seen that before the time of Offa
the silver coinage current in England consisted mainly
of the silver tremisses of Merovingian standard, <i>i.e.</i>
twenty to the Roman ounce, or 28·8 wheat-grains.
These are known to numismatists as silver pence of
the <i>Sceatt</i> series.</p>

<p>That these silver coins were those known by the
name of sceatts we seem to have the direct and independent
evidence of the following fragment ‘On
Mercian Law,’ already quoted but sufficiently important
to be repeated here.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Ceorles wergild is on Myrcna

<p class="lang2of2">The ceorl’s wergeld is in the

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Þonne bið cynges anfeald

<p class="lang2of2">Then is the King’s simple
wergeld six thanes’ wergeld by
Mercian law, <i>i.e.</i> 30,000 sceatts,
and that is in all 120 pounds.…</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Now, as previously observed, the sum of 30,000
sceatts must evidently be taken as a round sum.
The statement that the King’s simple wergeld was
120 pounds or six times the thane’s wergeld of 1,200
Mercian scillings seems to make this clear, for
7200 Mercian scillings of four sceatts (28,800 sceatts)
would amount exactly to 120 pounds.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
sceatts
minted
by Kentish
moneyers.</div>

<p>That the sceatts of this fragment of Mercian law
were the same silver coins as the scætts of the Kentish
laws is further confirmed by numismatic evidence.
The evidence of the coins themselves and of the
names of the moneyers impressed on them seems to
make it probable that to a large extent till the time
of Egbert, who was intimate with Charlemagne, and
perhaps even till the time of his grandson Ethelbald,
in the words of Mr. Keary, ‘Kent still provided
all the currency of the South.’<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> It would seem, therefore,
that practically during the whole period of the
issue of the silver pence of the Sceatt series the
greater part of them were minted by Kentish moneyers.
And thus numismatic evidence applies not only to
the coinage of Wessex but also to that of Mercia.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>We can hardly be wrong, then, in thinking that
this valuable fragment of Mercian law in using the
word sceatt referred back to ancient custom before
the sceatt had been superseded by the penny, and
therefore must be good evidence that the silver coins
called sceatts in Mercia were similar to those called
scætts in Kent. In other words the Kentish <i>scætt</i>,
notwithstanding the slight difference in spelling, was
almost certainly the silver <i>sceatt</i> of 28·8 wheat-grains,
<i>i.e.</i> twenty to the Roman ounce.</p>

<p>It is quite true that the word <i>sceatt</i> was used in
the laws in two senses, sometimes for ‘money’ or
‘property,’ and sometimes for the coin.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But so also
was the <i>scætt</i> of the Kentish laws.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> And it may not
always be easy to ascertain with certainty which
meaning is the right one.</p>

<p>But the Kentish and Mercian laws were not alone
in using the word for the silver coin. The phrase
‘sceatts and scillings’ was elsewhere used to denote
the typical smaller and larger monetary unit, or
perhaps we ought to say the silver and the gold unit.</p>

<p>In the tenth-century translation of the New Testament
the word <i>denarius</i> is translated by ‘pæning;’
for long before this the penny of 32 wheat-grains
had superseded the old coinage of the ‘Sceatt series.’
But in the translation of Ulphilas the word ‘<i>skatt</i>’ is
used for the silver <i>denarius</i>.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time it is important to observe that
the word <i>scilling</i> was the Gothic word applied to the
<i>gold solidus</i> in legal documents of the sixth century
during Gothic rule in Italy.</p>

<p>According to the bilingual records in the archives
of the Gothic church of St. Anastasia at Ravenna
payments were made in so many ‘skilligans.’<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> So
that probably silver skatts and certainly gold scillings
were familiar to the Goths of Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sceatts
and
scillings.</div>

<p>Again, sceatts and scillings were evidently the
two monetary units familiar to the mind of Cædmon
or whoever was the author of the metrical translation
of Genesis. In c. xiv. 23 Abraham is made to
swear that he would take neither ‘sceat ne scilling’
from the King of Sodom.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the fragment on Oaths<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> in the Anglo-Saxon
Laws (Thorpe, p. 76) the same phrase is used:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">On lifiendes Godes naman. ne
ðearf ic N. sceatt ne scylling. ne
pænig ne pæniges weorð.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">(s. 11) In the name of the
living God I owe not to N. <i>sceatt

penny’s worth.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely in both cases the phrase ‘sceatt ne scilling’
refers to coins or units of account of two
denominations in current use, as in the Kentish laws.</p>

<p>It is even possible perhaps to find an illustration
of the reckoning in sceatts and scillings in the
well-known passage in the ‘Scald’s Tale’ already
quoted.</p>

</div>

<p>If these words may be properly translated literally
‘Of sceatts in scillings reckoned’<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and are taken
to mean ‘600 sceatts in scillings reckoned,’ the
phrase accords very closely with the method of
reckoning in the Salic laws&mdash;‘so many hundred
denarii, <i>i.e.</i> so many solidi.’</p>

<p>Returning to the sceatts and scillings of the Laws
of Ethelbert, the most obvious suggestion would be
that the currency in Kent was similar to that on the
other side of the Channel under the Merovingian
princes. The two courts were so closely connected
by Ethelbert’s marriage, and probably by trade
intercourse, that the most likely guess, at first sight,
would be that the Kentish scætts were silver tremisses
and the Kentish scillings gold solidi like those of the
Lex Salica.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Merovingian currency was
mainly in <i>gold tremisses</i>, and as many of the 100 gold
tremisses contained in the celebrated ‘Crondale find’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
are believed by numismatists to have been coined
in Kent, by English moneyers, the currency of gold
tremisses in England is directly confirmed, though
the silver currency seems very soon to have superseded
it.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
scilling
of 20
scætts =
one ounce
of silver.</div>

<p>At the date of Ethelbert’s Laws (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 596) the
Merovingian currency was still mainly gold&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> gold
tremisses, three of which went to the gold solidus of
the Salic Laws. And if the scilling of Ethelbert, like
the solidus of the Franks, had been a solidus of forty
denarii we might have concluded at once that Ethelbert’s
scilling, like the Merovingian solidus, was a
solidus of three gold tremisses, or forty silver sceatts.</p>

<p>But the facts apparently will not allow us to come
to this conclusion.</p>

<p>Schmid has shown&mdash;I think, conclusively&mdash;by
inference from certain passages in Ethelbert’s Laws,
that the Kentish scilling was of <i>twenty</i> scætts instead
of forty.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> We therefore must deal with the Kentish
scilling on its own evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, twenty sceatts of 28·8 wheat-grains, as we
have seen, made the Roman ounce of 576 wheat-grains.
The Kentish scilling was therefore the
equivalent of an ounce of silver. And so in the
Kentish laws, so far as reckoning in silver was concerned,
the same method was adopted as that of the
Welsh, who reckoned in <i>scores</i> or <i>unciæ</i> of silver, and
that which became the common Frankish and Norman
reckoning of twenty pence to the ounce and twelve
ounces to the pound.</p>

<p>Indeed, when we consider that under common
Scandinavian custom gold and silver were weighed
and reckoned in marks, <i>ores</i>, and ortugs, it would
seem natural that the Kentish immigrants from the
North should have been already familiar with a
reckoning in <i>ores</i> or ounces of silver.</p>

<p>But why did they call the ounce of silver a scilling?
We might as well perhaps ask why the Wessex
scilling was five pence and the Mercian scilling four
pence. But the word <i>scilling</i> had, as we have seen,
been used by the Goths in Italy for the gold solidus.
And on the Continent the gold solidus in the sixth
and seventh centuries, and indeed till the time of
Charlemagne, was so far the recognised symbol of
value that the wergelds of the Northern tribes, whether
they remained in the north or emigrated southwards,
were invariably stated in their laws in gold solidi.
The most natural inference would therefore seem to
be that the Kentish scilling, like that of the Salic law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
must have been a gold solidus equated, however, in
account with twenty silver pence or scætts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kentish
scilling
probably
a solidus
of two
gold
tremisses
like the
Saxon
solidus.</div>

<p>Now, at the ratio of 1:10 the ore or ounce of
twenty silver scætts would equal a gold solidus of
two gold tremisses instead of three.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> And when it is
considered that the main Merovingian currency on
the other side of the Channel was of gold tremisses
it seems natural that the ounce of silver should be
equated with an even number of gold tremisses.</p>

<p>Nor would there be anything unprecedented or
unusual in a gold solidus of two tremisses instead of
three. For we have seen that when Charlemagne conquered
the Frisians and the Saxons, he found that the
solidi in which they had traditionally paid their
wergelds were not always, like the Imperial and the
Salic solidi, of three gold tremisses, but that each
district had its own peculiar solidus. The solidus of
the southern division of Frisia was of two and a half
gold tremisses. The solidus of the middle district
was the ordinary gold solidus of three tremisses. The
traditional solidus of the district presumably nearest
to the Jutes, <i>i.e.</i> on both the Frisian and the Saxon
side of the Weser, was the solidus of two tremisses.
The Saxon solidus of two tremisses, representing the
one-year-old bullock, was that in which according
to the Lex Saxonum the Saxon wergelds had been
traditionally paid.</p>

<p>We have no distinct mention of a Jutish solidus,
but as the Jutes probably came from a district not
far from that of the North Frisians and Saxons there
would be nothing abnormal or surprising in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
reckoning in the same solidus as their neighbours, viz.
in the gold solidus of two tremisses, and in the
Kentish immigrants continuing the same practice.
But this as yet is only conjecture.</p>

<p>So far, then, as the facts of the prevalent coinage
and currency are concerned, all that can be said is
that the hypothesis that the Kentish scilling was that
of two gold tremisses has a good deal of probability
in its favour. But there is other and more direct
evidence of the truth of the hypothesis.</p>

<p>In the first place, as already stated, in the preface
to King Alfred’s Laws he expressly mentions
his knowledge of the laws, not only of Ine and of
Offa, but also of Ethelbert, the inference being that
in his own laws he retained, <i>inter alia</i>, some of the
enactments of Ethelbert which were in his own view
worth retaining.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Confirmation
by
other
evidence.
The
King’s
mund-byrd
of
five
pounds
common
to Wessex
and Kent.</div>

<p>Now, King Alfred <i>fixed the king’s mund-byrd at five
pounds</i> of silver, <i>i.e.</i> 240 Wessex scillings, while he
must have known that in the Kentish law the king’s
mund-byrd was fifty Kentish scillings. The difference
in scillings must have struck him, but he probably
knew perfectly well what the Kentish scillings were.
For when we compare these two mund-byrds we
find that at a ratio between gold and silver of 1:12
(which, as we have seen, was the Frankish ratio of
Charlemagne’s successors) fifty Kentish scillings of
two gold tremisses did equal exactly five pounds. Fifty
Kentish scillings or 100 Merovingian gold tremisses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
at 1:12 were equal to 1200 silver tremisses
or sceatts of the same weight, <i>i.e.</i> five pounds
of 240 sceatts; or, in other words, 100 gold tremisses
(<i>nova moneta</i>) were equal at the same ratio to five
pounds of 240 of King Alfred’s pence of 32 wheat-grains.
The equation was exact.</p>

<p>And further, we have seen that in the time of Cnut
the Kentish king’s mund-byrd was well known and
declared to be five pounds according to Kentish law,
although in that law it was stated to be 50 scillings.</p>

<p>The passage has already been quoted from the
MS. G of Cnut’s Church law, s. 3, in which, after
stating that ‘the grith-bryce of the chief minster in
cases entitled to “bot” is according to the king’s
mund, that is five pounds by English law,’ the
additional information is inserted,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

</div>

</div>

<p>Further in the same MS. G of Cnut’s secular
law, s. 63, is the following:<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

killed let him lie unpaid for.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>It is not very clear what the <i>ham-socn</i> was. In
the Latin versions it is translated by ‘invasio domi.’
And it seems to be the same thing as the ‘heimsókn’ of
the Norse laws.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> It seems to be a breach of the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
within the sacred precinct of the ‘heim,’ and the
penalty seems to place it on the same ground as the
borh-bryce and mund-byrd of the king so as to have
become in Cnut’s time one of the crimes which in
Kent also involved a penalty of fifty Kentish scillings.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, the inference again is that fifty
Kentish scillings were equal in Cnut’s time to five
pounds of silver.</p>

<p>It is quite true that these two statements of
Kentish law are not found in the other manuscripts
of Cnut’s laws, so that in one sense they may be
regarded as interpolations, but in the MS. G they are
not insertions made afterwards. In both passages the
words form an integral part of the text, which
throughout is written in a clear and excellent hand.</p>

<p>It is difficult to suggest any reason for the insertion
of these two statements of Kentish law other than
the deliberate intention to point out that the amount
of the Kentish king’s mund-byrd of fifty Kentish
scillings was the same as the Wessex mund-byrd of
five pounds of silver.</p>

<p>In addition, therefore, to the fact that at a ratio
of 1:12 between gold and silver the two amounts
were alike, these passages seem to show that the
penalty of fifty Kentish scillings had become
permanently recognised in Cnut’s time as equal to
the English penalty of five pounds of silver.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>If the comparison had been made throughout in
silver sceatts, the equation would not have held good
so exactly, for 1000 sceatts would not have equalled
exactly five pounds, <i>i.e.</i> 1200 of the same sceatts.
The exact equation seems to have been between fifty
Kentish gold scillings of two tremisses, and five pounds
of silver at the current Frankish ratio of 1:12. So
that the direct evidence of these passages from Cnut’s
laws goes very far to verify the hypothesis derived
from numismatic considerations that the scilling of
the Kentish laws was a gold scilling of two tremisses,
like that of the Continental Saxons and North-East
Frisians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scætts
cannot
have been
farthings.</div>

<p>It is, however, only fair to say that Schmid, while
adhering to the view that the Kentish scilling was of
twenty sceatts, has suggested that these sceatts may
have been, not silver tremisses or pence, but <i>farthings</i>,
so that the Kentish scilling of twenty farthings might
be identical with the Wessex scilling of 5<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Konrad
von Maurer held the same view.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> But if this could be
supposed for a moment, the Kentish scætt would then
be only one quarter of the sceatt of the fragment of
Mercian law, and the mund-byrd of King Ethelbert
would be only a quarter of that of the Wessex King,
notwithstanding the assertion in MS. G of the Laws
of Cnut that the Kentish mund-byrd was five pounds
of silver, like those of other English laws. With all
deference, therefore, to the view of these great
authorities, a careful examination of the evidence
seems to lead to the conclusion that it cannot be
maintained. Nor does there appear to be any reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
why the Kentish scilling should be expected to be the
same as the Wessex scilling, as we know that the
Wessex scilling of 5<i>d.</i> differed from the Mercian
scilling of 4<i>d.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kentish

<p>We adhere, then, to the view that the Kentish
scilling was a scilling of two gold tremisses like the
Saxon solidus, and that it was equated with the ore
or Roman ounce of silver, <i>i.e.</i> twenty sceatts.</p>

<p>The reader will be able to form his own judgment
as to whether examination of the various clauses
of the Kentish Laws and the amounts of the wergelds
and other payments now to be considered will confirm
this conclusion or not. I think it will be found substantially
to do so.</p>

<h3>III. THE LAWS OF ETHELBERT.</h3>

<p>This heading probably did not form a part of the

<p>This clause is read by Thorpe and Schmid and

<p>Clause 2 enacts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mund-byrd
of
the King
50 scillings.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif cyning his leode to him

<p class="lang2of2">If the King call his <i>leod</i> to
him and any one there do them
evil, the bot is twofold and 50 scillings
to the King.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Here are two distinct things. The bot is the
payment to the person called to the King. While
thus in attendance any injury is to be paid for twofold.
The payment of fifty scillings to the King is
the mund-byrd or payment for breach of his protection
or peace.</p>

<p>Clause 3 is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif cyning æt mannes ham
drincæð ⁊ þær man lyswæs hwæt

<p class="lang2of2">If the King drink at any one’s
‘ham’ and any one there does
something wrong, then let him
pay twofold bot.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>That is, the presence of the King at a subject’s
house is the same thing as the subject being in the
King’s protection, and the bot for any wrong done to
the subject, while the King is there, is doubled.</p>

<p>Clause 4 enacts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif frigman cyninge stele .ix.
gylde forgylde.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If a freeman steal from the
King, let him pay ninefold.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>It seems at first sight hardly likely that the Archbishop
should be compensated elevenfold and the
King only ninefold, but as this is repeated in the
statement of the Kentish law in the fragment ‘Of Grith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
and of Mund’ the text may be taken as correct.</p>

<p>Clause 5 enacts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif in cyninges túne man
mannan ofslea .l. scill. gebete.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If a man slay another in the
King’s tun, let him make bot with
50 scillings.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The bot here again is evidently the mund-byrd
payable to the King for breach of his protection, <i>i.e.</i>
fifty Kentish scillings.</p>

<p>Clause 6 enacts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif man frigne mannan ofsleahð
cyninge .l. scill to drightin-beage.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If any one slay a freeman, 50
scillings to the King as <i>drihtin-beag</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Here again the payment is to the King, but in
this case, if the word is to be taken literally, it is not
perhaps for breach of his peace, but for the <i>killing of
his man</i>. He claims it as his ‘drihtin-beag’ or
lord’s-ring. It is, to use the later Saxon phrase, the
King’s manbot or value to him of his man killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King’s
smith
and outrider
pay
a <i>medume</i>
wergeld.</div>

<p>Up to this point the question of wergeld has
not been mentioned at all. But in clause 7 is the
following:<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif cyninges ambiht-smið oþþe
laad-rinc mannan ofslehð. meduman
leodgelde forgelde.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If the King’s <i>ambiht-smith</i>
[official-smith] or <i>laad-rinc</i> [outrider]
slay a man, let him pay a
<i>medume leodgeld</i>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Liebermann would insert the word ‘man’ after
‘gif’ and so read this clause as stating the wergeld
of the King’s smith and laadrinc-man when <i>slain</i> to
be a ‘medume wergeld’ (mittleres wergeld). But
the clause is complete as it stands without the
insertion of ‘man,’ and, read as it is, means that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
smith and the outriders of the King, if they slay a man,
are to pay a ‘medume leodgeld.’ But what does
this mean? The word <i>medume</i> was translated by
Wilkins by ‘moderata.’ Thorpe read the phrase as
meaning ‘a <i>half</i> wergeld;’<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Schmid as a ‘fit and
proper’ one; and Liebermann would take it to refer
to the wergeld of a person of middle rank or
position. We must leave the true meaning for the
present in doubt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason
why not
a full
wergeld.
Their
dangerous
work.</div>

<p>Apart from the amount of the wergeld, if we
would understand this passage we have surely first to
consider for what reason these two royal officials
should be singled out from all others and made liable
to pay wergelds. The inference must be that in the
performance of their duties they were peculiarly liable
to injure others. The King’s smith in his smithy
forging a weapon, and the outrider forcing a way for
the King through a crowd, might very easily through
carelessness or in the excitement of work cause the
death of another. The necessity apparently had arisen
to check their action by making them liable to pay a
wergeld.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> But the wergeld was not to be the usual
one. It was to be a ‘medume leodgelde.’</p>

<p>For the present the exact meaning may be left
open, but whether the true reading be a half-wergeld
or not, the inference seems to be that a <i>full</i> wergeld
was not to be paid. Probably it had come to be recognised
that a person engaged in a specially
dangerous trade could not be held responsible to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
same extent as in the case of an ordinary homicide.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
These considerations are important, because the
‘medume’ wergeld will again claim notice and every
hint is valuable when, as in the case of these laws,
we have only hints to guide us.</p>

<p>In Clause 8, the King’s mund-byrd is declared to
be fifty scillings; and the next two clauses relate
to injuries done to the King’s servants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bots for
harm done
to King’s
servants.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif man wið cyninges mægden-man

<p class="lang2of2">10. If any one lie with a
King’s maiden, let him pay a bot
of 50 scillings.</p>

</div>

<p class="lang2of2">11. If she be a grinding slave,

forgelde.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">12. Let the King’s <i>fed-esl</i> be
paid for with xx scillings.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>These bots are evidently payable to the King for
injuries done to him by abuse of his servants of
different grades. They were not wergelds.</p>

<p>We have now done with these bots to the King,
and the laws turn to consider injuries done and bots
due to the <i>eorl</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bots due
to the
eorl.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="lang2of2">14. If a man lie with an <i>eorl’s

scillings.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>And then from the bots due to the eorl the laws
pass to those due to the ceorl. The following clauses
show that under the Kentish laws the ceorl also had
a mund-byrd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bots due
to the
ceorl.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Ceorles mund-byrd .vi. scillingas.</p>

scillings; if with the slave of the

</div>

</div>

<p>Thus we get a scale of mund-byrds or penalties
due for breach of the peace or protection of the
King, the eorl, and the ceorl:&mdash;</p>

<p class="lang2of2">23. If the slayer depart from

leod.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>These clauses taken together and followed carefully,
I think, become intelligible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How
treated
in Alfred’s
and in
Ine’s laws.</div>

<p>A man lends weapons to another who is engaged
in a brawl, and the question arises how far he is to
be responsible for what happens in the brawl. In
the case dealt with in these clauses two things are
involved&mdash;the lending of the weapons and the joining
thereby in the fray. In the later laws there are
provisions for both points. Under King Alfred’s laws
(s. 19) the man who lends his weapon to another
who kills some one therewith has to pay at least one
third of the wergeld unless he can clear himself from
evil intention.</p>

<p>Under Ine’s laws (s. 34) a man who joins in a
fray in which someone is killed, even if he can clear
himself from the slaying, has to pay as bot (<i>gebete</i>)
one fourth of the wergeld of the slain person whether
twy-hynde or ‘dearer born.’ Under Alfred (29 to
31) the actual slayer has to pay the wergeld, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
addition each of the others in the fray has to pay as
‘hloð-bote’ 30 scillings for a twy-hynde man, 60 for
a six-hynde, and 120 for a twelve-hynde man.</p>

<p>These later precedents may materially help us in
the understanding of the Kentish clauses.</p>

<p>Clauses 18 and 19 make the lender of the weapon
pay a bot of six scillings though no evil be done or
only street robbery occur.</p>

<p>Clause 20 provides for the case in which the man
to whom he lent the weapon was slain, and in this
case the bot is raised to twenty scillings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lender
pays a
<i>medume</i>
wergeld
for person
slain.</div>

<p>Clause 21 seems to deal with the case of some one
else being slain, and makes the lender liable to pay a
bot of a ‘medume leod-gild’ of 100 scillings for
mixing in the fray. It would be natural that the bot
should be greater if another was slain than if the
man to whom he lent the weapons had been slain.
And if the later precedents are to guide us, the bot
of a ‘medume wergeld’ should not in amount equal
the whole wergeld but only a proportion of the
wergeld. If the bot of 100 scillings might be
considered as equal to a <i>half</i>-wergeld we should gain
a clue to what the whole wergeld might be. And
this would be a tempting inference. But we are not,
it seems, as yet warranted in making it. We must
therefore at present content ourselves with the
conclusion that the ‘medume wergeld’ cannot mean
a whole wergeld, otherwise the lender of the weapon
would pay as <i>bot</i> as much as the wergeld would be
if he had killed the man himself.</p>

<p>Clause 22 makes 20 scillings payable at the open
grave and the whole leod in forty nights. It refers
apparently to the actual slayer’s liability to pay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
whole wergeld (<i>ealne leod</i>); and finally clause 23
states that if the slayer depart from the land his
kindred shall pay <i>half</i> the wergeld of the slain
person. We are not told to whom the bot of the
‘medume wergeld’ of 100 scillings was to be paid, nor
whether it was to be a part of the wergeld or
additional to the ‘ealne leod’ paid by the actual
slayer. The later laws, as we have seen, afford precedents
for both alternatives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kindred
liable for
half the
wergeld
and slayer
for the
other half.</div>

<p>Another point of interest arises from the last
clause. In the absence of the slayer his kindred had
to pay only a half wergeld (<i>healfne leod</i>). Does this
justify the inference that in all cases of wergelds
the liability of the kindred was confined to one half?
It will be remembered that in the so-called ‘Canones
Wallici’ (<i>supra</i>, p. 109), if the slayer had fled, the
<i>parentes</i> of the slayer had fifteen days allowed for
their payment of one half or flight from the country.
And only when they had paid their share could the
slayer return and make himself safe by paying the
other half&mdash;the ‘medium quod restat.’ It seems not
unlikely that in the Kentish case also ecclesiastical
influence had limited the liability of the kindred to
the half-wergeld.</p>

<p>Clauses 25 and 26 are important, and we shall
have to recur to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three

<p>Next follow three clauses upon edor-breach. The
first relates to the breach by a freeman of the
enclosure or precinct presumably of a freeman, the
penalty being the same as the ceorl’s <i>mund</i>. The
second imposes a threefold bot upon theft from
within the precinct. And the third refers to a

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bots for

hand, or
foot 50
scillings.</div>

<p>Then follow chapters relating chiefly to injuries
done and wounds inflicted, and the bots payable
to the person injured for the same. It is not needful
to mention more of these than the most important
one, viz. that for the destruction of an eye, hand,
or foot. The bots for all these in most other laws
were alike. In Ethelbert’s Laws the bot for each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of the three is fifty scillings, which happens to be
the same as the mund-byrd of the King.</p>

<p>After the clauses for injuries there are several
relating to women.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Injuries
to women.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif fri wif locbore les wæs

<p class="lang2of2">73. If a lock-bearing free wife
does wrong, xxx scillings bot.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Mægþbot sy swa friges

<p class="lang2of2">74. The maiden-bot is like a

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Mund þare betstan widuwan

<p class="lang2of2">75. The mund of the best
eorlcund widow is a bot of l scillings.
Of the second rank xx
scillings, of the third xii scillings,
of the fourth vi scillings.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif man widuwan unagne

<p class="lang2of2">76. If a man carry off a widow
not in his mund, her mund shall
be twofold.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The clause relating to the mund of the four
grades of apparently eorlcund (?) widows does not help
us much to an understanding of what the grades of
Kentish society may have been. But it emphasises
a remarkable trait of these laws of Ethelbert.
Every class is divided in these laws into grades.
The clergy are divided into grades from bishops to
clerks. The female servants of the King’s household
are divided into three classes, and so are the servants
of the ceorl’s household. The læts are divided into
three classes. And now the widows, whether all
eorlcund or not, are divided into four classes for the
purpose of their mund. The significance of these
divisions will be apparent hereafter. In the meantime
the mund is probably the amount to be paid by
a second husband to the parents or kindred of the
widow.</p>

<p>Passing from the mund of the widow, the
following clauses throw some light upon the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
of the wife under Kentish custom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position
of a wife

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif mon mægþ gebigeð,

<p class="lang2of2">77. If any one buy a maid, let

him bring her home again and let

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif hio cwic bearn gebyreþ,

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif mid bearnum bugan wille

<p class="lang2of2">79. If she wills to go away with

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif ceorl agan wile swa an

<p class="lang2of2">80. If the husband wills to have

<p class="lang2of2">81. If she bear no child, let
[her] paternal kindred have the
property and morgengift.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>It is obvious from these clauses that under
Kentish custom the position of the wife was very
much the same as under Cymric and continental
German custom. The marriage was a fair contract
between the two kindreds.</p>

<p>The next clause enjoins a payment of fifty
shillings to the ‘owner’ of a maiden if she be
carried off by force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kentish
esne.</div>

<p>Lastly there are the following clauses relating to
the position of the esne under Kentish custom. The
esne is considered to be a ‘servus’ working for hire
rather than a theow.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang2of2">87. If an esne’s eye and foot are

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang2of2">88. If a man bind a man’s
esne, vi scillings bot.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>There is nothing in these clauses, I think, to show
that the bot was payable to any one but the owner
of the esne.</p>

<p>What the ‘full worth’ of the esne was we are
not told.</p>

<h3>IV. THE LAWS OF HLOTHÆRE AND EADRIC, A.D. 685-6.</h3>

<p>Between the date of the Laws of Ethelbert and
those of other Kentish kings which have been preserved
nearly a century had intervened. So that
these later laws of Kent are nearly contemporary
with King Ine’s Dooms of Wessex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eorlcund
and
ceorlisc
classes.</div>

<p>As in Ethelbert’s laws, the main division of classes
of freemen seems still to have been that between
eorlcund and ceorlisc. But we get further valuable
information.</p>

<p>The Laws of Hlothære and Eadric open with
clauses which seem to fix the wergeld of the eorl at
three times that of the ordinary freeman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
owner’s

for an

<p>They deal with the liability of an owner of an
<i>esne</i><a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> for his servant’s homicides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">If an esne

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="lang2of2">1. If any one’s esne slay an
<i>eorlcund</i> man, one that is paid for

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p class="lang2of2">2. If the slayer escape, let him
add a fourth <i>manwyrth</i> and let
him prove with good compurgators
that he could not catch the
slayer.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The next two clauses are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">If he slay
a freeman.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif mannes esne frigne mannan

<p class="lang2of2">3. If anyone’s esne slay a
freeman, one that is paid for with
100 scillings, let the owner
give up the slayer and a second

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif bana oðbyrste, twam manwyrðum

<p class="lang2of2">4. If the slayer escape, let
[the owner] pay for him with
two manwyrths and let him prove
with good compurgators that he
could not catch the slayer.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>This reading of these clauses is not that of
Thorpe or of Schmid, but that approved by the best
authorities.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Were the
wergelds
300 and
100, or
are they
half-wergelds?</div>

<p>Following this reading as philologically the most
correct one, the inference at first sight might be that
under Kentish law the wergeld of the eorlcundman
was 300 Kentish scillings and that of the freeman
100 scillings.</p>

<p>But there may be reason to doubt the correctness
of such an inference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
clauses
limit and
lessen the
owner’s
liability.</div>

<p>For the present we may leave the question of the
amount of the wergelds to consider the meaning of
the clauses in their main intention. And this seems
to be clear. Henceforth the owner of an esne was
not to be accountable for the wergeld of the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
slain or any part of it further than that if an eorlcundman
payable for with 300 scillings be slain he
must hand over the esne and <i>three</i> times his manworth
in addition; and in the case of the freeman
payable for with 100 scillings he must hand over the
esne and add <i>one</i> manworth in addition. That is to
say, the esne was in both cases to be handed over
and a manworth for each hundred scillings of the
amount at which the person slain is paid for.</p>

<p>Now, I think, we must conclude that these clauses
were intended to make an innovation upon ancient
custom rather than to confirm it. And therefore it
may be well to compare with them the parallel
evidence of the laws of other tribes, as to the
responsibility of an owner for his slave’s homicides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Under
tribal
custom
at first
complete.</div>

<p>Under the Welsh Laws (ii. p. 105) the liability of
the owner of a slave for his homicides was apparently
complete.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If a bondman commit homicide of whatever kind, it is right
for the lord of the bondman to pay for the deed of his bondman
as for a murderer, for he is a murderer.</p>

</div>

<p>And this probably must be taken as the general
rule of tribal custom in its early stages.</p>

<p>In the laws of the Saxons and of the Anglii and
Werini the ancient German tribal custom was still
preserved. The owner of an animal or a slave was
liable for any injury done by either, very much as if
it had been done by himself (‘Lex Sax.’ xii. Ang.
and Wer. 16 and 52).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Then
made a
half-wergeld
only, and
the slave
to be
handed
over for
the other
half.</div>

<p>But it would seem that Roman and Christian
feeling very early suggested that this was hard upon
the innocent owner. Hence in some of the laws the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
compromise was made that the owner should pay
only a <i>half</i>-wergeld and hand over the offending
animal or slave instead of the other half.</p>

<p>That this innovation was not altogether acceptable
to tribal feeling is shown by clauses in the
‘Pactus III.’ of the Alamannic laws. The whole
wergeld was to be paid by the owner if his horse, ox,
or pig killed a man (s. 18). But an exception was
made in the case of the dog. If a man’s dog killed
any one, a <i>half</i>-wergeld (medium werigeldum) was to
be paid, and if the whole wergeld was demanded, all the
doors but one of the house of the person making the
demand were to be closed and the dog was to be hung
up nine feet from the only one left open for ingress or
egress, and there it must remain till it fell from putrefaction.
If it was removed or any other door was
used, the wergeld was to be returned (s. 17).</p>

<p>Grimm (‘D. R.’ p. 665) has pointed out that in the
<i>Ostgotalaga</i> (Drap. 13, 2) a similar archaic practice is
described when a <i>slave</i> had killed a man. The <i>owner</i>
of the slave under this law ought to pay the whole
wergeld, and if he did not do so the <i>slave</i> was to be
hung up at <i>his</i> (the owner’s) house door till the body
putrefied and fell. Thus the same archaic method of
punishing the delinquent was retained in both cases.
But the significant point is that so long as the whole
wergeld was due from the owner it was at the
owner’s door that the body of the slayer was to be
hung up, while when the <i>half</i>-wergeld only was to
be paid, the dog was to be hung up at the door of
the person who improperly demanded the whole
wergeld. Thus, as in so many other cases, the twelfth-century
laws of the North preserved the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
custom of the payment of the whole wergeld, while
the Alamanni, after migration into contact with
Roman and Christian civilisation, in their laws of
the seventh century modified the custom, at the
same time retaining the archaic method of forcing
compliance with the modification. It must be
remembered that every change which relieved the
innocent owner from liability, wholly or in part,
robbed the kindred of the person slain of the whole
or the part of the wergeld.</p>

<p>The compromise of payment of the half-wergeld
and the handing over of the offending animal or slave
was not confined to the Alamannic laws.</p>

<p>In the Ripuarian Law xlvi. the animal which had
killed a man was to be handed over and received ‘in
medietatem wirigildi’ and the owner was to pay the
other half.</p>

<div class="sidenote">So in
Codex I.
of Lex
Salica, but
afterwards
owner
released
from the
half-wergeld.</div>

<p>In the Lex Salica the same rule was at first
applied to the case of homicide by a slave or læt.
A half-wergeld was to be paid and the slave or læt
handed over for the other half.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> This was the rule
according to the Codex I. But in the later Codices,
VII. to X., and in the ‘Lex Emendata,’ the lord, if
innocent, was allowed to get off altogether from the
half-wergeld and had only to give up the slave or
the læt. This further innovation seems to have
been connected with the Edict of Chilperic (<i>circ.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
574) and thus probably represented the result of
ecclesiastical influence at very nearly the date of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
earliest Kentish laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the
Canons of
sixth
century
the slave
was to be
given up
and
another
besides.</div>

<p>We have only to recur to the Canons of the Celtic
Church of Brittany and South Wales of the sixth and
seventh centuries, considered in the earlier part of
this volume, to recognise the hand of the Church
in these innovations upon earlier tribal custom.
They extended to Celtic as well as to German
districts. In Canon 5 of the so-called ‘Canones
Wallici’ the rule was laid down that ‘if any master
should permit his slave to carry arms, and the slave
killed a freeman, the owner must hand over the slave
and another besides’ (<i>supra</i>, p. 108).</p>

<p>The half-wergeld here is omitted altogether, and,
as in the case of the Kentish freeman, two slaves are
to be given up instead of one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the
Burgundian
Law
slave to
be given
up and
the owner
to be free.</div>

<p>These Canons were nearly contemporary with the
later Kentish laws, and the same stage of innovation
seems to have been reached in both. A still further
and final stage had been reached in the Burgundian
Law already quoted (<i>supra</i>, p. 124) in which in the
case of homicide by a slave, unknown to his master,
the slave was to be delivered up to death and the
master was to be free from liability. The <i>parentes</i>
of the slain person were to get nothing, not even the
slave, ‘because, as we enact that the guilty shall be
extirpated, so we cannot allow the innocent to suffer
wrong.’ The whole process of change had taken
place in the Burgundian district by the sixth
century. But it would seem that in Kent the middle
stage only had been reached at the date of the laws
of Hlothære and Eadric.</p>

<p>Evidence that the further stage had at last been
reached in Anglo-Saxon law is perhaps to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
in the nearly contemporary law of Ine (s. 74) which
enacts that if a <i>theow-wealh</i> slay an Englishman, the
owner shall deliver him up to the lord and the
kindred or give sixty scillings for his life. Here no
further manworths are required. But possibly the
peculiar position of the <i>theow-wealh</i> may have something
to do with it, so that we ought not perhaps to
assume as certain that the clause represented a still
further general innovation upon tribal custom beyond
that described in the Kentish clauses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kentish
clauses
meant to
modify
the previous
rule:
which
may have
been the
half-wergeld
of 300
and 100
scillings.</div>

<p>Returning to the Kentish clauses and assuming
that their direct intention was to modify previous
custom, we are now in a position fairly to judge what
the <i>previous</i> rule may have been.</p>

<p>Reasoning from the analogy of other laws, it seems
most likely to have been to make the owner pay a
half-wergeld of the person slain and hand over the
esne for the other half&mdash;the stage of custom reached
in the Ripuarian Laws and Salic Laws of Codex I.</p>

<p>And if this were in fact the former custom
previous to the enactment in these clauses, then
without departing from the correct literal reading of
the text it may be that the words in the parenthesis
in each clause may refer, not to the eorlcundman’s
or the freeman’s wergild&mdash;the word ‘<i>leod</i>-geldi’ is
not used&mdash;but to the amount hitherto payable in the
particular case of a man slain by an esne. The
300 and 100 scillings may be the <i>half</i>-wergeld
hitherto payable, instead of which thenceforth the
owner of the esne is to pay three manworths or one
manworth in addition to handing over the esne.</p>

<p>If previous to the innovation the eorlcundman
had been paid for in such a case with three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
shillings and the freeman with one hundred, the words
in their strictly correct literal meaning might perhaps
rightly be read thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If any one’s esne slay an eorlcundman, one who <i>is</i> [now] paid
for at three hundred scillings, let the owner [in future] give up the
slayer and add <i>three</i> manworths [of the esne] thereto.</p>

<p>If anyone’s esne slay a freeman, one who <i>is</i> [now] paid for at
<i>one</i> hundred scillings, let the owner [in future] give up the slayer
and add one manworth [of the esne] thereto.</p>

</div>

<p>This reading of the clauses, putting emphasis
upon what is <i>now</i> the gild (þane ꝥ sie)&mdash;the <i>three</i>
and the <i>one</i> hundred scillings&mdash;in contrast with what
the owner has in future to do, <i>i.e.</i> pay <i>three</i> manworths
and <i>one</i> manworth instead of the <i>three</i>
hundred and <i>one</i> hundred scillings in addition to the
handing over of the esne&mdash;seems to me more than any
other rendering to account for the insertion of the
parenthesis stating the amounts payable for the
eorlcundman and freeman. If the word <i>leod-gylde</i>
had been used it might have been different. But I
am informed on the best authority that the words
<i>gylde</i> and <i>gelde</i> in the two clauses are not substantives
but used in an adjectival sense, and in this case they
would apply to a half-wergeld payable as correctly as
to a whole one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was 100
scillings
the half-wergeld
and so the
medume
wergeld
of King
Ethelbert’s
laws?</div>

<p>At the same time the mention of 100 scillings, if
the payment be a <i>half</i>-wergeld, may help to an
understanding of the <i>medume</i> leodgeld of 100 scillings
mentioned in Ethelbert’s Laws. It suggests that the
<i>medume</i> wergeld was a modified or middle one which,
like the <i>medium</i> werigeldum and <i>medium</i> precium of
the mediæval Latin of the Alamannic and other laws,
had come to mean a <i>half</i> one. Perhaps, after all, if
we recognise clerical influence in the framing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
modification of the Kentish laws, the translation of
the Latin ‘<i>medium werigeldum</i>’ by the Anglo-Saxon
‘<i>medume leodgeld</i>’ is not very unnatural.</p>

<p>Before we leave the laws of Hlothære and Eadric
there are one or two further clauses worth notice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">System
of oath-helpers.</div>

<p>Clause 5 reminds us that, though scarcely mentioned
in these laws, the system of compurgation
was in force. A freeman charged with a crime has
to clear himself by the oaths of a number of ‘free
æwda-men.’</p>

<p>Clause 6 makes mention of the protection of a
woman by her kindred:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of
the wife.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif ceorl acwyle be libbendum

<p class="lang2of2">6. If a husband (ceorl) die

[cattle?] till he be ten winters
old.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>These clauses, unimportant perhaps in themselves,
are useful as showing that behind the silence
of the laws tribal custom still lingered on, however
seldom and slightly it might be brought into
evidence as fresh circumstances might suggest new
clauses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mund-byrds
unchanged.</div>

<p>There are also some clauses which are useful
as showing the continuance of the mund-byrds of
king and ceorl of King Ethelbert’s Laws, unchanged
in amount, a century later.</p>

<p>By s. 11, if a man uses abusive words to another
in any one’s ‘flet,’ ‘let him pay one scilling to him
who owns the “flet” and six scillings to him to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
he said the words and twelve scillings to the King.’
So also in s. 12, one scilling is to be paid to the
owner of the ‘flet,’ six scillings to the person
wronged, and twelve scillings to the king. The six
scillings to the person insulted or wronged is the
<i>mund</i> of the freeman or ceorl. Lastly, in s. 13 in
case of a slaying in a drinking bout:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif man wæpn abregde þær
mæn drincen ⁊ þær man nan yfel
ne deð scilling þan þe ꝥ flet age
⁊ cyninge xii scill.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If a man draw a weapon
where men are drinking and no
harm be done, then a scilling to
him who owns the flet and xii
scillings to the King.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif ꝥ flet geblodgad wyrðe
forgylde þem mæn his mund-byrd
⁊ cyninge l. scill.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If the flet be stained with
blood, let him pay to the man
[who owns the flet] his mund-byrd
and 50 scillings to the King.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mund-byrd
of
the King
still 50
scillings
and of the
ceorl 6.</div>

<p>Thus we have again the mund-byrds of King Ethelbert’s
Laws:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Of the King 50 scillings.</li>
<li>Of the ceorl 6 scillings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The crime of killing another in a drinking bout
is a breach of the <i>mund</i> of the owner of the ‘flet’ as
well as a breach of the peace of the King.</p>

<h3>V. THE LAWS OF KING WIHTRÆD, A.D. 690-696.</h3>

<p>One more chance remains for further information
regarding Kentish wergelds, viz. in the ‘Laws of
King Wihtræd,’ who became King of the Kentish
men about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 690 and, according to Bede, died
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 725. A century had passed since the Laws of
Ethelbert were enacted, in the time of St. Augustine.
Brihtwald was now Archbishop of Canterbury, and at
an assembly of Church and people ‘the great men
decreed, with the suffrage of all, these dooms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
added them to the lawful customs of the Kentish men.’
These laws are mainly ecclesiastical both in their
origin and subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mund-byrd
of
King and
Church
both 50
scillings,
and so no
change
in the
Kentish
currency.</div>

<p>In the first two clauses the Church was declared
to be ‘free from gafols,’ and the mund-byrd of
the Church was declared to be the same as the
King’s, viz. fifty scillings&mdash;as in Ethelbert’s Laws.
There is therefore no marked change in the Kentish
currency, though by this time it must have been
almost entirely silver so far as any Kentish coinage
was concerned.</p>

<p>Clause 5 introduces us for the first time in the
Kentish laws to the distinction between the <i>gesithcund</i>
and <i>ceorlisc</i> classes.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif þæs geweorðe gesiðcundne
mannan ofer þis gemot ꝥ he
unriht hæmed genime ofer cingæs
bebod ⁊ biscopes ⁊ boca dom
se ꝥ gebete his dryhtne .c. scill.
an eald reht. Gif hit ceorlisc man
sie gebete .l. scill.…</p>

<p class="lang2of2">When it happens to a gesithcundman
after this gemot that he
enters into unlawful marriage
against the command of the King
and the bishop and the book’s
doom, let him make bot for it to
his lord with 100 scillings according
to ancient law.
If he be a <i>ceorlisc</i> man, let him
make bot with 50 scillings.…</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>It would not do to conclude from this single
allusion to gesithcund and ceorlisc men that the
Kentish division of classes&mdash;eorlisc and ceorlisc&mdash;had
given way before the Wessex division of classes&mdash;gesithcund
and ceorlisc.</p>

<p>There had been no interval between this and the
last set of Kentish laws long enough to have made
likely any radical change in social conditions, and as
the ‘ancient law’ alluded to was probably ecclesiastical
and not especially Kentish, either in its origin or
its terms, it would not be wise to build anything upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
the use of the word ‘gesithcund’ beyond recognising
the natural tendency of neighbouring peoples
under the same ecclesiastical influence to approximate
in phraseology especially in regard to matters of
general ecclesiastical interest.</p>

<p>Clauses which follow regulating the penalties for
work on Sundays, or neglect of baptism, or a ceorl’s
making offerings to devils without his wife’s knowledge,
or a man’s giving flesh meat to his family on
fast days, do not interest us in this inquiry further
than as revealing lingering traces of paganism and
the ecclesiastical character of these laws of Wihtræd.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few clauses which incidentally
come within the lines of our inquiry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The position
of the
freedman
under
Kentish
custom.</div>

<p>Clause 8 is especially interesting as showing that
when freedom was given by a lord to his man and
he became folkfree, still, even though he left the
district, his <i>inheritance</i>, his <i>wergeld</i>, and the <i>mund</i> of
his family remained with the freedom-giver.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gif man his mæn an wiofode
freols gefe se sie folc-fry. freolsgefa
age his erfe ænde wer-geld ⁊
munde þare hina sie ofer mearce
þær he wille.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">If any one give freedom to his
man at the altar, let him be folkfree;
let the freedom-giver keep
the heritage and wergeld and
the <i>mund</i> of his family, be he
over the march wherever he will.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">His wergeld
goes
to his
lord.</div>

<p>Here tribal custom asserts itself. The freedman,
though freed at the <i>altar</i>, is to be <i>folkfree</i>, and yet,
although folkfree and able to go wherever he will,
he cannot <i>inherit</i>, because he is nobody’s heir. He
had no free parents from whom to inherit. His lord
inherited what his unfree man might leave behind
him. The freedman’s wergeld if he were slain still
went to his lord, for he had no free kindred to claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
it. His family remained in the lord’s <i>mund</i> unless
they also had been set free.</p>

<p>These points were doubtless all incident to the
position of a newly made freedman under Kentish
custom, and this enactment was probably needful only
to make it clear that freedom given <i>at the altar</i>,
whatever churchmen might think, was not to modify
the customary rules incident to freedom-giving. The
evidence of the clause is, however, valuable because
for one moment it accidentally lifts the veil and shows
that Kentish tribal custom was in these matters much
the same as we have found tribal custom elsewhere,
and it is particularly valuable as direct evidence that
there was a class of freedmen under Kentish custom
as everywhere else.</p>

<p>There are also the following clauses on oaths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clauses
on oaths
of different
persons.</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Biscopes word ⁊ cyninges sie
unlægne buton æðe.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">16. A bishop’s and a King’s
word is unimpeachable without
an oath.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Mynstres aldor hine cænne in
preostes canne.</p>

<p class="lang2of2">17. A ‘Minster’s ealdor’
clears himself in the same way as
a priest.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Preost hine clænsie sylfæs soðe

<p class="lang2of2">18. A priest clears himself by
his own declaration in his holy
garments before the altar, saying
‘I speak the truth in Christ, I do
not lie.’ And so also does the
deacon.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Cliroc feowra sum hine clænsie

<p class="lang2of2">19. A cleric shall clear himself
as one of four of his like;
with one hand on the altar, the
others standing by and accompanying
the oath.</p>

</div>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Gest hine clænsie sylfes aðe

<p class="lang2of2">20. A stranger (gest) shall
clear himself by his own oath at
the altar, and in the same manner
as a ‘King’s thane.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<div class="langs">

<p class="lang1of2">Ceorlisc man hine feowra sum
his heafod-gemacene on weofode

<p class="lang2of2">21. A ceorlisc man shall clear
himself with four of his like at
the altar, and the oath of all these
shall be unimpeachable.…</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Under
clerical
influence
the single
oath of
the
stranger
to be
taken as
good.</div>

<p>These statements regarding oaths, like other laws
of Wihtræd, betray their ecclesiastical origin, and
following directly after the imposition of penalties for
what may be called ecclesiastical sins, very difficult
of proof, seem to have been inserted with special
reference to them. They are interesting, however, as
reminding us again that the system of oath-helpers
was not absent from Kentish custom.</p>

<p>Section 20 of this clause is also interesting, which
places the <i>stranger</i> (gest)&mdash;may we not say the ‘King’s
guest’?&mdash;in the same position as the ‘King’s thane’
as to the validity of his single oath. Both seem to
be specially under the King’s protection: in the case
of the King’s thane, on account of his official or
military position; in the case of the stranger, probably
because of the absence of his kindred. The King
being in the place of kin to the stranger, his single
oath is accepted.</p>

<p>These laws end with clauses referring to theft
more or less closely resembling those so prominent
in King Ine’s Dooms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clauses
as to
theft like
those in
Ine’s laws.</div>

<p>They state that a thief slain as a thief was to be
without wergeld. If a freeman were caught in the
act of thieving, the King might either kill him, or sell
him over sea, or release him on payment of his
wergeld. He who should seize and hold him was to
be entitled to the half-wergeld, or if he were put to
death to seventy scillings. A man coming from far or a
foreigner, when off the public way, who should neither
call aloud nor blow a horn, was to be taken to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
thief, and put to death or redeemed by a wergeld.</p>

<p>The last clause resembles Ine s. 20 so closely as
to suggest a common origin.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="langs">

<div class="lang1of2">

<p class="center">(Wihtræd, 28)</p>

<p>Gif feorran cumen man oþþe
fræmde buton wege gange ⁊ he

</div>

<div class="lang2of2">

<p class="center">(Ine, 20)</p>

<p>Gif feor cuman man oððe

for ðeof he bid to profianne oððe
to sleanne oððe to alysanne.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p>The close resemblance between these clauses confirms
the suggestion that the expression ‘gesithcund’
in the Kentish laws of Wihtræd may have been
borrowed from Wessex. Nowhere else than in these
contemporary laws of Ine and Wihtræd does the term
gesithcund appear, except in the fragments of Mercian
law, which may thus belong to the same period.</p>

<h3>VI. THE DIVISION OF CLASSES UNDER KENTISH CUSTOM.</h3>

<p>We have now examined the Kentish laws especially
regarding the amount of the wergelds and mund-byrds.
Although we may not have arrived at absolute
certainty, yet some light may have been thrown upon
the important matter of the division of classes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mund-byrds
of
King,
eorl, and
ceorl.</div>

<p>So far as the amounts of the wergeld are concerned,
the contrast was between the eorl and the
freeman, the wergeld of the eorl being three times
that of the freeman. But as regards the mund-byrd
the contrast was between eorl and ceorl. The mund-byrds
were:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Mund-byrd values">
  <tr>
    <td>King</td>
    <td class="tdr">50</td>
    <td>Kentish scillings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eorl</td>
    <td class="tdr">12</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ceorl</td>
    <td class="tdr">6</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>There must evidently be either identity of meaning
or much overlapping in the terms freeman and ceorl.
Otherwise the ceorl would be without a wergeld and
the freeman without a mund-byrd.</p>

<p>And yet, on the other hand, there was probably
some reason why the particular words used were
chosen in the several clauses, and to a certain extent
it may not be far to seek.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ceorl
was a man
with a
household
and flet
and so had
a mund-byrd.</div>

<p>So far as the word <i>ceorl</i> had a special sense, it
meant the married man,<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> the husband with a homestead
and household, like the North-country husbandman
with his husbandland. In this special
sense every ceorl may have been a freeman, but
every freeman may not have been a ceorl. Hence in
the clauses as regards mund-byrd the contrast is
between the eorl and the ceorl. Both were men
with homesteads and households. Unless they had
persons under their ‘mund’ they could not have had
corresponding mund-byrds. The freeman who did
not happen to be a man with a homestead and household
could have no mund-byrd, because he had no
precinct within which his peace could be broken, and
no household under his protection. But he could
have a wergeld.</p>

<p>So, again, in the clauses quoted relating to injuries
done to servants in the Laws of Ethelbert:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>14. If a man lie with an eorl’s birele, let him make bot with
xii scillings.</p>

<p>16. If a man lie with a ceorl’s birele, let him make bot with
vi scillings. If with a theow of the second class, l sceatts; if with
one of the third class xxx sceatts.</p>

<p>25. If any one slay a ceorl’s hlafæta, let him pay bot with vi
scillings.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>The ceorl in this contrast is again a husbandman
with a homestead and household and with bireles
and theows and hlafætas under his roof or in his
‘ham.’ Wherever in the Kentish laws the word
‘ceorl’ is used in any other sense, I think the meaning
is confined to that of the married man&mdash;the husband,
as in the phrase ‘husband and wife.’</p>

<p>So regarded, the division for purposes of mund-byrd
into eorlisc and ceorlisc classes was natural,
and so also, for purposes of wergeld, was the distinction
between eorl and freeman. As regards
the wergeld, we may consider the terms ceorl and
freeman as practically interchangeable, inasmuch as
every ceorl was certainly a freeman, and the unmarried
freeman was probably a cadet or member of
the household of some eorlisc or ceorlisc man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Continental society included everywhere, as we
have seen, such classes as the Roman liti and liberti
composed of strangers and freedmen who had not so
far risen in the social scale as to have fully recognised
rights of inheritance and whose wergeld never was of
the same amount as that of the full freeman. It is
in connection with such classes that the tribal distinction
of blood came in. If for the full freeman we
were to substitute the word <i>tribesman</i>, with all the
background of hyndens of kinsmen to fight and to
swear for him involved in the term, then from the
same point of view we must expect to find in Kent, as
everywhere else, strangers in blood below the tribesmen,
like the aillts and alltuds and taeogs of the
Cymric Codes, the fuidhirs of the Brehon Laws, if not
the liberti and liti of the Gallo-Romans, or, perhaps
still more nearly to the point, the leysing classes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
the Norse Laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kentish
freedman
and læt
resembled
the Norse
leysing.</div>

<p>We have already found incidental mention of the
Kentish freedman. He cannot after enfranchisement
have been classed as an esne or a theow. There
would seem to be no other class mentioned to which
he could belong, unless it might be that of the læts
of Ethelbert’s Laws.</p>

<p>It is worth while, therefore, to recur to the single
clause in Ethelbert’s Laws already quoted respecting
the læts and to examine it more closely. Within the
compass of its few words there may perhaps be found
evidence connecting the status of the Kentish læt
with what we have learned of the status and conditions
of the Norse leysing.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>26. If a man slay a læt of the best class, let him pay 80 scillings;
if one of the second class, let him pay 60 scillings; of the
third, let him pay 40 scillings.</p>

</div>

<p>The clause does not mention to whom the payments
are to be made, whether to the læt himself or,
as in the case of the freedman, to his late owner or
lord. But the payments are not called leodgelds as
are the wergelds of freemen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
classes
in both
cases.</div>

<p>Looking to the payments themselves they are
graduated for three classes of læts. There were
also, under Norse custom, three classes of leysings
gradually growing by successive steps towards a higher
grade of freedom as kindreds grew up around them
and became more and more nearly perfect till at last
the ninth generation from the first freedman became
fully free. Why may not the three grades of Kentish
læts have been doing the same?</p>

<p>Let us compare the amounts of the payments for
the slaying of the three classes of Kentish læts with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
those for the three classes of Norse leysings.</p>

<p>We have seen over and over again that the
Kentish scilling regarded as twenty sceatts was an
ore or a Roman ounce of silver. Therefore the
Kentish payments, stated in ounces of silver, were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Best class of læt</td>
    <td class="tdr">80</td>
    <td class="nw">ounces of silver</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Second class</td>
    <td class="tdr">60</td>
    <td><span class="ditto1">”</span> <span class="ditto2">”</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Third class</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
    <td><span class="ditto1">”</span> <span class="ditto2">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The Norse ore was also in wheat-grains a Roman
ounce of silver. The wergelds of the three classes of
leysings in the Norse laws were as under:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Frialsgiafi or newly made freedman</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
    <td class="nw">ores of silver</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leysing after making ‘freedom ale’</td>
    <td class="tdr">60</td>
    <td><span class="ditto1">”</span> <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leysinjia-son or highest rank of leysing whose great-grandfather was a leysing<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></td>
    <td class="tdr vb">80</td>
    <td class="vb"><span class="ditto1">”</span> <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="sidenote">And the
wergelds
similar.</div>

<p>So that the wergelds of the three classes of
Kentish læts corresponded exactly in amount with
those of the three classes of Norse leysings, when
reckoned both in silver.</p>

<p>We may further compare these payments for the
Kentish læts with those for the freedman of the nearly
contemporary Bavarian laws. They are stated in gold
solidi of three tremisses, and the Kentish solidus was
of only two tremisses. We have seen that the Bavarian
freedman was paid for with forty solidi, <i>i.e.</i> sixty
Kentish scillings. The payment thus corresponded
with that for the Kentish læt of the second class.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
grades
the result
of growth
of kindred.</div>

<p>These correspondences are unexpected and very
significant, but the significance is made still more
important by the clause in the Laws of Wihtræd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
describing the position of the newly made freedman
under Kentish custom. The description of his
position might almost be taken as a description of
the ‘frialgiafi’ or newly made leysing of the Norse
laws. Under Kentish law the freedman was to be
folkfree, but ‘the freedom-giver was to keep the
heritage and wergeld and mund of his family, be he
over the march wherever he will.’ This was, as we
have seen, almost exactly the position of the Norse
leysing before he had made his freedom ale. He had
as yet no kindred to swear and to fight for him. He
was still under the mund and protection of his lord.
His descendants could only obtain the protection of
a kindred and become wholly free from the <i>thyrmsl</i>
of the lord, when in the course of generations a
kindred had grown up gradually around them.</p>

<p>So too, as we have seen, under the Bavarian laws
the freedman’s wergeld went to his lord.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Under the
Frisian law the wergeld of the <i>litus</i> went to his lord.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
Under Ripuarian law even the ‘homo denarialis’&mdash;the
freedman who became a Frank with a full
wergeld&mdash;was recognised as having at first no kindred.
If he had no children, his property went to the fisc.

descendants had full rights of inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> We
have already found abundant evidence of the continued
force of tribal custom and tribal instincts
in regard to the importance of kindred while considering
the meaning and function of the hyndens in
connection with the twelve-hynde and twy-hynde
classes of the Anglo-Saxon laws. These remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
correspondences between the position held by the
læts in Kent and that of the leysings and freedmen

too much of them, may fairly be taken as additional
evidence of the tenacity of tribal custom in these
matters.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<h3>VII. THE AMOUNT OF THE KENTISH WERGELDS.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Probable
Kentish
wergelds
eorl 600,
freeman
200,
Kentish
scillings.</div>

<p>Once more we return to the amount of the
wergelds of the Kentish eorl and freeman.</p>

<p>We have seen reason to believe that the payments
of 300 and 100 scillings of the laws of Hlothære and
Eadric were half-wergelds, and that the full wergelds
were 600 and 200 scillings.</p>

<p>If they may be so considered they are at once put
on line with the Frankish wergelds. The threefold
wergeld of the eorl becomes evidently due to his
noble birth or official position. And, if the Kentish
and Frankish solidi had been alike, the similarity of
the wergelds would have been complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As in the
Frankish
laws.</div>

<p>The wergelds of the Frankish group of laws were
found to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>In all these cases the wergeld of the Royal official
or person in high rank is threefold that of the <i>liber</i>
or <i>ingenuus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Confirmed
by comparison
with the
King’s
mundbyrd.</div>

<p>Confining attention now to the position of the
Kentish freeman, further confirmation of the view
that his wergeld was 200 Kentish scillings may be
derived from a comparison of the King’s mundbyrd
with his wergeld, and the corresponding Continental
payments <i>pro fredo</i> with the wergelds of the <i>liber</i> and
<i>ingenuus</i> of the Continental laws.</p>

<p>The Kentish mundbyrd of 50 Kentish scillings
was one fourth of the Kentish freeman’s wergeld if
200 Kentish scillings.</p>

<p>The Mercian mundbyrd of five pounds of silver
was one fourth of the Mercian wergeld of 1200 scillings
of four pence, or twenty pounds.</p>

<p>The Wessex mundbyrd of five pounds would be
one fourth of the Wessex wergeld proper if the latter
might be looked upon as the same as the Mercian
with the mundbyrd added.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>The Alamannic and Bavarian payments <i>pro fredo</i> of
40 solidi were one fourth of the Alamannic and
Bavarian wergeld of 160 solidi.</p>

<p>And Brunner<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and others consider that, although
the payment <i>pro fredo</i> was sometimes an extra payment,
the 200 solidi of the Frankish wergeld equalled 160
solidi with one fourth added <i>pro fredo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, if instead of holding the Kentish freeman’s
wergeld to be 200 Kentish scillings we were to take it
to be the <i>medume</i> wergeld of 100 scillings, we should
destroy the correspondence of the King’s mundbyrd
with the wergeld, and make the mundbyrd half the
wergeld instead of a quarter: unlike what it was in the
other laws. This hardly seems a likely supposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And also
with payment
for
eye, hand,
and foot.</div>

<p>We get still further evidence if we compare the
payments for the eye, hand, and foot in the Kentish
and Continental laws. We have seen that the
Kentish payment was 50 scillings, <i>i.e.</i> the same as
the King’s mundbyrd and one fourth of the wergeld
of 200 scillings. In the Alamannic and Bavarian
laws and in those of the Chamavi the payment for
these, like the payment <i>pro fredo</i>, was one quarter of
the freeman’s wergeld. In the Frankish laws it was
one half. But the reason of this is, not that either
the Frankish payment <i>pro fredo</i> or the wergeld is
less than in other laws, but that the payment for
the eye, hand, and foot is greater. The Frankish
payment for the eye, hand, or foot was 100 solidi of
three tremisses, <i>i.e.</i> half as much again as the Kentish
freeman’s wergeld would be if only 100 Kentish
scillings of two tremisses; which again seems unlikely.</p>

<p>At first sight the Wessex payments for the eye, hand,
and foot present an anomaly. The Wessex twelve-hynde
wergeld of 1200 Wessex scillings of five pence
at a ratio of 1:10 corresponds, as we have seen, with
the Frankish freeman’s wergeld of 200 solidi. The
payment for the eye, hand, and foot in King Alfred’s
Laws is 66⅔ Wessex scillings, <i>i.e.</i> only one eighteenth
of the twelve-hynde wergeld. But the explanation no
doubt is that in the Laws of King Alfred the payments
for injuries are stated for the <i>twyhynde</i>-man’s grade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
those for the eye, hand, and foot being one third of
the twyhyndeman’s wergeld of 200 Wessex scillings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kentish
freeman’s
wergeld
most
likely 200
Kentish
scillings,
or 4000
sceatts.</div>

<p>On the whole, therefore, these considerations seem
to strengthen the supposition that the Kentish freeman’s
wergeld was 200 Kentish scillings. That the Kentish
wergeld should differ from that of Mercia and Wessex
need not surprise us, seeing that we started with the
warning that we should find it so as regards both the
<i>barones</i> and <i>villani</i>. To the writer of the so-called Laws
of Henry I. the eorl was no doubt the <i>baro</i> and the
freeman or ceorl the <i>villanus</i> of Norman phraseology.
And we need not wonder at his confusion if he had
nothing but the laws to guide him. It is necessary,
however, to look at the question of the wergelds
from a broader point of view than his could be.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the Continental
wergelds of the Merovingian period were all stated in
gold solidi. The first emigrants into Britain must have
known this perfectly well. Kentish moneyers coined
gold tremisses, and when they afterwards coined
silver it was in silver tremisses of the same weight,
which earned the name in England of ‘sceatts.’</p>

<p>Any exact comparison of English and Continental
wergelds must obviously be dependent upon
the ratio between gold and silver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Archbishop
Egbert’s
priest’s
wergeld
also 4000
sceatts&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
200
ounces of
silver or
<i>Mina
Italica</i>
of gold.</div>

<p>The Kentish scilling of two gold tremisses at
1:10 was reckoned in the Laws of Ethelbert as equal
to 20 sceatts&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to the Roman ounce&mdash;and the
wergeld, if of 200 scillings, was thus, as we have seen,
a wergeld in silver of 200 ounces or 4000 sceatts. We
have seen also that Archbishop Egbert claimed for his
priests a wergeld of 200 ounces of silver, which thus
would accord exactly with the Kentish wergeld of 200<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
scillings. It might almost seem that he may have consulted
his colleague the Archbishop of Canterbury
and fixed his clerical demand in accordance with the
Kentish wergeld rather than with that of Wessex or
Mercia.</p>

<p>Nor was there anything unnatural or abnormal
in the Kentish wergeld of 200 ounces of silver, inasmuch
as 200 Roman ounces of silver at a ratio of
1:10 would equal the <i>Mina Italica</i> of twenty
Roman ounces or of two ancient Roman pounds of
gold.</p>

<p>We may therefore with confidence, but without
claiming certainty, fairly state the Kentish wergelds
in Kentish scillings and sceatts, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kentish
wergelds.</div>

<p>And when put together in this way the proportion
between the wergeld of the freeman and that of the
læts becomes important. In the Norse laws the
leysing’s wergeld was one sixth that of the hauld or
odalman. In the Bavarian and Saxon laws the
wergeld of the <i>litus</i> was one fourth that of the freeman.
Anything like these proportions in Kent
would make a wergeld as low as 100 scillings for
the freeman very improbable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
sceatts
could not
have been
farthings.</div>

<p>Lastly, perhaps it may be fair to the reader to recur
once more to the question of the Kentish scilling. If
any doubt should remain as to whether we are right
in regarding the sceatt as the silver coin of that name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
twenty of which went to the Roman ounce until it
was superseded by the penny of Offa and Alfred,
surely that doubt must now be dispelled. For if,
according to the view of Schmid and others, the sceatt
were to be taken as a farthing or <i>quarter</i> of a sceatt,
the correspondence of Kentish with Continental
wergelds and payments <i>pro fredo</i> would be altogether
destroyed. The eorl’s triple wergeld at a ratio of
1:10 would be only one sixth (and if 300 scillings
only one twelfth) of that of the Frankish noble or
official, while the Kentish freeman’s wergeld would be
reduced to one sixth (or if 100 scillings to only one
twelfth) of that of the Continental <i>liber</i> or <i>ingenuus</i>.</p>

<p>One perhaps must not say that such a result would
be impossible. But would it be a likely one? We
should have to suppose that the Jutish chieftain,
perfectly familiar with the Continental wergeld of the
freeman as 200 or 160 gold solidi, equated by long
tradition with the round number of 100 head of
cattle, upon settlement in Kent reduced the wergeld
of the freeman to one sixth or one twelfth of what it
was in the country he came from. From what we
know of the tenacity of tribal custom everywhere,
especially as regards the amount of the wergelds, it is
difficult to conceive of his doing so.</p>

<h3>VIII. RESULT OF THE KENTISH EVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>We are now in a position to take a broader view
of the wergelds, Continental, Kentish, Wessex, and
Mercian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kentish,

200 and
160 gold

100 head

<p>To the incidental mention of the fact that the
Kentish freeman’s wergeld, if 200 Kentish scillings,
equalled the gold <i>Mina Italica</i> may be added the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
further incident that it was equal to 100 ‘sweetest
cows’ of the Alamannic laws. Whether accidental
coincidences or not, these facts bring us back to the
point with which this inquiry started, viz. the widespread
normal wergeld of 100 head of cattle and its
very general traditional equation with a gold mina.</p>

<p>The main facts elicited as to the amount of the
wergelds in the course of this inquiry are these.</p>

<p>At the date of the Kentish Laws and generally
during the seventh century we find three wergelds in
use in England for the freeman:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">

    <td>The Wessex wergeld of</td>

    <td>at 1:10</td>
    <td>= 400 <span class="ditto1">”</span> <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And on the Continent we find the two wergelds:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Wergeld values">
  <tr>
    <td>Frankish</td>
    <td>200 solidi</td>
    <td>= 600 gold tremisses</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The other</td>
    <td>160 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
    <td>= 480 <span class="ditto1">”</span> <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Now, in the fairly contemporary laws of the Ripuarian
Franks, and of the Burgundians, the traditional
values of animals we have found to be stated as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Values of animals">
  <tr>
    <td>Ox</td>
    <td>2 solidi</td>
    <td>= 6 gold tremisses</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Cow</td>
    <td>1 solidus</td>
    <td>= 3 <span class="ditto1">”</span> <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And in the nearly contemporary Alamannic laws the
traditional values were:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Values of animals">
  <tr>
    <td>Best ox</td>
    <td>= 5 gold tremisses</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium ox and sweetest cow</td>
    <td>= 4 <span class="ditto1">”</span> <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="sidenote">The differences
covered
by ratio
between
gold and
silver
1:10 and
1:12.</div>

<p>Within the range of these variations in the ratio
between gold and silver, and in the local value of
animals, there seems to be ample room and reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
the variations in the money values of the wergelds.</p>

<p>(1) 100 oxen of 6 tremisses (<i>i.e.</i> 600 tremisses)
equal the Frankish wergeld of 200 gold solidi, and at
1:10 the Wessex wergeld of 6000 sceatts.</p>

<p>(2) A long hundred of 120 cows of 4 tremisses
(<i>i.e.</i> 480 tremisses) would equal the wergeld of 160
gold solidi, and at 1:10 the Mercian wergeld of
4800 sceatts.</p>

<p>(3) 100 cows at 4 tremisses (<i>i.e.</i> 400 tremisses)
make the Kentish wergeld of (if we are right) 200
Kentish scillings of 2 tremisses, and at 1:10, 4000
sceatts. If we change the ratio to 1:12, then a
Kentish wergeld of 100 cows of 4 tremisses would in
silver equal the Mercian wergeld of 4800 sceatts. In
other words, the difference between the Kentish and
Mercian wergeld may be explained, either as one
between 100 and 120 cows, or, the number of cows
remaining at 100, between the ratios of 1:10 and
1:12.</p>

<p>There is thus in these fairly contemporary values of
Western Europe, in the seventh century, or within the
Merovingian period, so obviously room for the variations
in the wergelds that, whether as to origin the
differences may be of historical interest or not, at any
rate for our present purpose we are fairly warned by
the general coincidence in the wergelds not to make
too much of the differences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kentish
freeman
and the
twelve-hyndeman
= Continental
<i>freeman</i>.</div>

<p>The Kentish laws, therefore, lead us with some
confidence to recognise the practical identity of the
wergeld of the Kentish freeman with that, not of
the Wessex ceorl, but of the twelve-hyndeman.</p>

<p>We have been led cautiously step by step to this
result, and, whether the problem raised by it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
capable of solution or not, it is important that it
should be fairly stated and considered. Even if the
Kentish freeman’s wergeld was only 100 Kentish
scillings, it would more nearly correspond with the
six-hyndeman’s wergeld than with that of the Wessex
ceorl. On the other hand, the wergelds of the Kentish
læts are very fairly on a level with that of the Wessex
ceorl. Taking an average between the second and
third class of læts the correspondence would be exact.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kentish
læt and
the twy-hyndeman
= the
Continental
<i>freedman</i>.</div>

<p>If, therefore, the wergeld of the Kentish freeman
may be regarded as practically equivalent to that
of the Continental <i>liber</i> or <i>ingenuus</i> on the one hand,
and to that of the twelve-hyndeman of the Anglo-Saxon
laws on the other hand, and if that of the Kentish
læt was like that of the Norse leysing and of the
twy-hyndeman, then once more it becomes natural
and right, and in accordance with ancient custom,
that in the Compact between Alfred and Guthrum the
twelve-hyndeman should be made ‘equally dear’
with the Norse hauld, and so with the <i>liber</i> or
<i>ingenuus</i> of the Continental laws, while the twy-hyndeman
should be held ‘equally dear’ with the
Danish leysing.</p>

in their old homes or settled in newly conquered

seemingly a matter of race. Cymric and German
customs were singularly similar.</p>

<p>If the Irish eric fine formed an exception, Irish
tribal custom nevertheless had many things in
common with Cymric and German custom in other
respects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The solidarity
of
the kindred
connected
with
family
holdings.</div>

<p>It was from a study of the wergelds and the rights
and liability of relatives in their receipt and payment
that some idea was gained of the solidarity of the
kindred under tribal custom. And this solidarity of
the kindred was found to be closely connected with
the family character of tribal land-holdings, of which
the Cymric gwely was a typical example. Where
direct evidence of this family element was wanting
the liability of the kindred for the wergeld remained
as an indication that it once had existed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
normal
wergeld of
200 gold
solidi or
100 head
of cattle.</div>

<p>In reviewing the evidence of these matters and
attempting to bring the results to a focus, we begin
with the fact that with comparatively few exceptions
the normal wergeld of the full or typical freeman was
everywhere so large&mdash;200 gold solidi, the heavy mina
of gold, traditionally representing 100 head of cattle.
This wergeld was too large by far for the individual
slayer to pay, and possible only as a payment from
one group of kindred to another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Anglo-Saxon
wergelds
brought
with them
into
Britain.</div>

<p>We have seen reason to infer from the Kentish,
Wessex, and Mercian wergelds that the Anglo-Saxon
tribes shared in these traditions, and, so to speak,
brought their wergelds with them into Britain. And
we have found that Anglo-Saxon custom as regards
the wergelds was substantially similar to that of the
Continental tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No feud
or wergeld
within the
kindred.</div>

<p>From Beowulf we learned that, as there could be
no feud within the kindred, a homicide within the
kindred could not be avenged or compounded for.
There was no galanas or wergeld in such a case under
either Cymric or German custom, and evidence was
found in the so-called Laws of Henry I. that it
had been so also under Anglo-Saxon custom. Up to
the time of the Norman Conquest the punishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
parricide was practically left by the laws to the
spiritual jurisdiction of the Church (<i>supra</i>, p. 335).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wergelds
paid and
received
by paternal
and
maternal
relations.</div>

<p>The principle which required both paternal and
maternal relations to join in the payment and receipt
of wergelds, and nearly always in the proportion of
two thirds and one third, was also common to
Cymric and German tribes. This principle depended
upon a view of marriage likewise common to both.
A blood relationship was established as regards children
of a marriage, while husband and wife for many
purposes remained in their own kindreds. There
being no blood relationship between husband and
wife, the husband’s kindred alone were liable for his
crimes and the wife’s alone for her crimes, and
neither the husband nor the wife received any portion
of the other’s wergeld or was liable for his or her
homicides. Such was the custom under the Cymric
codes and the laws of the Bretts and Scots, and Anglo-Saxon
custom as described in the so-called Laws of
Henry I. was similar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The half
wergeld
of
strangers
in blood.</div>

<p>The tribal feeling which allowed tribesmen and
strangers to live side by side under their own laws,
and made the Salic and Ripuarian Franks award a
full wergeld to tribesmen of allied German tribes, while
it gave only a half wergeld to the Gallo-Roman possessor
who was not of their blood, was, it would seem,
brought with the invading tribes into Britain.</p>

<p>Danish and English tribesmen were allowed to
live side by side under their own laws and acknowledged
as ‘equally dear,’ with a similar wergeld, while,
at all events in the cases which come under notice,
complete strangers in blood were awarded only a
half wergeld as in the Continental laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>We have not attempted to settle the question how
far there was a Romano-British population left in the
towns, but we have found incidental traces and hints
that in Northumbria, Wessex, and Mercia there were
‘wilisc’ men&mdash;Welsh or British&mdash;who had only a
half wergeld, being treated as strangers both in this
respect and also as regards the substitution of the
ordeal for the oaths of kindred (p. 403).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ordeal
the
alternative
to the
oaths of
kinsmen.</div>

<p>The principle that a man who could not bring to
his protection the oath of his kinsmen must be brought
to the ordeal was one of widely extended tribal
custom. And it was emphasised by the adoption of
the ordeal as a Christian ceremony solemnly performed
in the churches under both Frankish and Anglo-Saxon
law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The man
of no
kindred
becomes
a dependent
on
some one
else’s
land.</div>

<p>There can be little doubt that in the solidarity
of the kindred under tribal custom we have to do
with the strongest instinct which everywhere moulded
tribal society. So far as it had its way and was not
confronted by more potent forces it must have almost
necessarily ruled such matters as the division of classes,
the occupation of land, and the modes of settlement.</p>

<p>When we inquire into the grades of society under
tribal custom they seem everywhere to have their
roots in the principles of blood relationship. A man
who has no kindred to protect him needs and seeks
the protection of a chieftain or lord. By the force
of tribal gravitation he sinks into the dependent condition
of living upon another’s land.</p>

<p>Whether he be a freedman who has risen from the
rank of the theow or thrall, or a free tribesman of low
position, or one of a conquered race, or a stranger
immigrant, and whether he be cottier or the holder
of the typical yardland, until in the course of generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
a kindred has grown up around him, he remains
in the dependent condition. He is indeed a freeman
as compared with the theow or thrall, but when
Alfred and Guthrum make their compact and agree
that Dane and English shall be reckoned as equally
dear at the normal wergeld of the full freeman it is
not of the dependent class they are thinking. They
give to this class and to the Danish leysing or newly
made freedman a twy-hynde instead of a twelve-hynde
wergeld.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The twy-hynde
class was
the dependent
class
of gafolgeldas,
with a
lower
wergeld.</div>

<p>It might at first sight be supposed that this twy-hynde
condition of the dependent class in England,
so far as it may have included Anglo-Saxons, must
have been the result of degradation in social status
between the first settlements and the time of King
Alfred, but we have sought in vain for evidence of an
earlier higher position in the Laws of King Ine. And,
on the whole, even when regarded solely from a tribal
point of view, it does not seem unlikely that strangers
in blood and freedmen and dependent followers of
the conquering chieftains should find themselves after
conquest and settlement in the economic condition of
tenants and gafolgeldas on the lands of protecting
lords. Nor would it be strange that, when in a new
country and under other influences this uniform
dependent economic condition had once become a
general fact, the whole class, in spite of variety of
origins, should find itself marked by a twy-hynde
wergeld.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The twy-hynde
class were
equated.</div>

<p>It does not follow, however, that because in the
compact between Alfred and Guthrum the twy-hynde
class were reckoned as equally dear with the Norse
leysing that the Anglo-Saxon ‘ceorl who sits on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
gafol-land’ was generally in as low a social position
as the Norse newly made freedman. It is enough
that according to the evidence, he was a dependent
tenant, let us say, under the lordship of a twelve-hynde
man or if settled upon royal demesne of some
gesith or official of the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">With the
Norse
leysing.</div>

<p>Still it may be well to look once again at the
position of the Norse leysing, because, after all, it is
with the leysing that the Anglo-Saxon twy-hynde
gafolgelda was equated in a compact made after
King Alfred’s victory, and so when the two chieftains
seemed to be treating on equal terms. Surely King
Alfred was not intending to degrade the Anglo-Saxon
dependent class. Presumably he was making
a good bargain for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The low
condition
of the
leysing.</div>

<p>The early Norse laws were settled long after the
date of this compact, upon the conversion of South
Norway, and, as in other cases, they were framed with
the express purpose of making room in the legal
system for the Christian Church and so in some
sense with its sanction. And yet so deep was the
gulf between classes even then that a certain portion
of the churchyard was set apart for leysings, and in
no case were they to be buried in the portion reserved
for classes above them. And if after giving
his freedom-ale and so attaining the first step in
freedom and independence the leysing should die
leaving destitute children whose support ought not
to be thrown back upon his lord, we have seen that
the way out of the difficulty was to dig a grave in the
churchyard into which the leysing’s children were to
be placed and left to starve to death, the last
survivor being the only one which the lord thenceforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
had to maintain.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> This was the position of the
leysing at the bottom of the ladder of freedom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But he
rose by
steps as
a kindred
grew
around
him.</div>

<p>But we found the leysing of the Norse laws
rising by steps into greater freedom and better social
position. And the process throughout was founded
upon the gradual growth of kindred. It was the
lack of kindred to swear for them and defend them
which placed them low in the social scale, and it was
the gradual growth of kindred generation after generation
which marked the steps of their rise into better
social position with higher wergelds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In England
it
was so
once, but
the rungs
of the
ladder
drop out.</div>

<p>When we turn to the Anglo-Saxon laws we seem
to detect similar tribal principles originally at work
but with differences which may very probably be
referred to the circumstances attendant upon conquest
and settlement in Britain.</p>

<p>The law of tribal gravitation here as elsewhere,
aided, no doubt, by other potent forces, had been at
work placing the man with an imperfect kindred in
a dependent position at the bottom of the social
ladder.</p>

<p>And it is important to note that at first the
middle rungs of the ladder by which a man could
climb out of the dependent position seem to have
been present here as in Norway. The evidence is
scanty, but sufficiently important.</p>

<p>From the Kentish laws the presence of stepping-stones
into greater freedom may be inferred in the
case of the three classes of <i>læts</i> with their rising
wergelds. And in a precious fragment of ancient
custom happily rescued from oblivion we found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
evidence that, originally at all events, there had been
a way out of the ceorl’s twy-hynde condition at the
fourth generation of landholding connected with
payment of gafol to the king’s utware and direct
service to the king. But we recognised that the
collector of the fragment looked longingly back to
ancient custom, speaking of it in the past tense, as
if it was no longer in force.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>It would obviously not be wise to trust solely to
the negative evidence of the silence of the laws, but
in this case the silence seems to confirm the evidence
of the fragment. For the pathetic tone of the fragment
finds an echo in the fact that all traces of the
middle rungs in the ladder seem to have vanished
from the later laws. There is no mention in Ine’s
laws or in Alfred’s of there being or having been
several grades of freedmen or læts. Even the half
wergeld of the six-hynde stranger who has risen to
the possession of five hides silently disappears after
King Alfred’s time. From whatever cause, so far as
the evidence goes, the twy-hynde class seems to have
become a homogeneous class in which, in spite of
different origins, distinctions were merged in a
common economic condition. Differences of origin
were perhaps forgotten as the result of comradeship
in the long struggle against the Danish foe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And this
kept open
the gulf
between
twy-hynde
and
twelve-hynde
classes.</div>

<p>We thus seem to be driven to recognise the width
and to some extent the bridgelessness, already in
King Alfred’s time if not in King Ine’s, of the gulf
between the position of the twelve-hynde landed class
and that of the twy-hynde dependent class of gafolgeldas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
and geburs who were tenants on their land.</p>

<p>It seems probable that, though technically and
really free in the sense of not being thralls, the
twy-hynde class, broadly speaking, may have found
themselves very early, if not from the first, placed in
an economic condition of service and servitude,
including work as well as gafol, which by the ultimate
disappearance of the middle rungs of the ladder
might very easily slide into what is loosely called the
‘serfdom’ of later times.</p>

<p>In the meantime we realise that the abjectness of
this semi-servile condition may be very easily exaggerated
by modern associations with the terms ‘service’
and ‘serfdom.’</p>

<p>It is when we turn from the twy-hynde class to
the position of the class above them, of gesithcund
and twelve-hynde men, that we learn that a part at
least of the risk of misunderstanding may lie in the
difference between the tribal notion of service and
freedom and the more modern one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position
and services
of
the twelve-hynde
class.</div>

<p>What, then, has tribal custom to teach us as to
the position and services of the twelve-hynde class?</p>

<div class="sidenote">On a level
with the
Norse
odalman.</div>

<p>Reverting once more to the compact between
Alfred and Guthrum, Dane and English are to be
equally dear at eight half-marks of gold. The Englishman,
without any limiting adjective, is the twelve-hynde
man. And he is put on a level with the
Danish typical free landholder, the hauld or odalman
of the Norse laws, whose wergeld under Norse law
was that of the typical freeman everywhere&mdash;equivalent
to the normal wergeld of 200 gold solidi, the
mina of gold, the traditional wergeld of 100 head of
cattle. It was six times that of the Norse leysing, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
as the twelve-hyndeman’s wergeld in England was six
times that of the ‘ceorl who sits on gafol land.’</p>

<p>The English twelve-hynde man is therefore put
on a level with the Norse odaller or typical landholder.
And so, as we have seen, the ceorl who rose
by the middle rungs of the ladder into the twelve-hynde
position had <i>inter alia</i> to become a landholder
of 5 hides, and his family became gesithcund only after
the landholding had continued to the fourth generation.
His great-grandchildren then became gesithcund
with a twelve-hynde wergeld.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Twelve-hynde
men were
landholders.</div>

<p>The twelve-hyndemen were therefore landholders,
surrounded, in principle at least if not always in
practice, by a kindred. But what kind of a landholding
was it?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position
of the first
settlers.</div>

<p>Approaching the question strictly from a tribal
point of view, the solidarity of the kindred involved
in the payment and receipt of wergelds would certainly
suggest that those who had a right to receive
and the obligation to pay held a position in their
kindred quite different from that of the modern
individual owner of land.</p>

<p>The analogy of Welsh and Irish and Salic and
Norse and Scanian tribal custom would lead us to
infer that the Anglo-Saxon settlers in England must
have brought with them traditions of tribal or family
ownership more or less of the type of the Cymric
gwely, though doubtless modified by emigration and
settlement in a new country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Separation
from
their kindreds
threw
them on
the protection
of
the king.</div>

<p>After all that has been said, traditions and perhaps
actual examples of the individual ownership of the
‘Romanus possessor,’ and, still more likely, actual
experience of the Roman type of landed estates, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
have survived in Britain from the period of the Roman
occupation, and the Anglo-Saxon settlers may easily
have been influenced in the matter of landholding by
what as conquerors they came to supplant. But they
can hardly have wholly cast off their own tribal traditions
and instincts. The continued payment and receipt
of wergelds show that they did not. Even, to take an
extreme case, if they came to Britain as single settlers
having left their kinsmen behind them, still kindreds
would gradually grow up around their descendants in
the new country. And tribal custom left to itself would
give to them landed rights, quite different from those
of the individual owner. But the interval, apart from
other outside influences, may well have subjected
tribal custom to a strain.</p>

<p>From the point of view of this interval it may not
be unreasonable to revert to the clauses of King
Alfred’s laws on ‘kinless men’ and the Norman precedent,
that the king was to take the place of the
missing maternal kindred and of advocate for a
Norman if he had no other.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Unless, therefore, the twelve-hynde settler was
surrounded by a full kindred in the new country, he
must, according to his own tribal custom, have found
himself much more of an individual than he was used
to be, and therefore more dependent upon the protection
of his chieftain or king.</p>

<p>We must not, on the one hand, conceive of the
twelve-hynde settler as having all at once adopted the
independent position of the Roman ‘possessor,’ though
circumstances may have sometimes severed him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
completely from his ‘parentilla’ as the ceremony of
the Salic law. Nor can we, on the other hand, conceive
of him always as a tribesman surrounded by his
kindred. He may evidently, on the one hand, be
released from many of the trammels involved in
membership of a kindred, but, on the other hand, he
is thrown more than ever under conditions of service
to the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Service
under
tribal custom
not
degrading.
But the
ties of
kindred
involved
restraint
on
individual
action.</div>

<p>Let us for a moment revert to the tribal conception
of these trammels and services. They did not
always involve degradation of social condition. They
often, as we have seen, were the mark of the attainment
of a higher position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Norse
odalman
a sharer
in the
odal, with
duties to
his
kindred.</div>

<p>The kindred of the aillts or strangers who settled
upon a chieftain’s land under Cymric custom was
acknowledged in the fourth generation of continued
occupation, but at the moment a kindred was
acknowledged its members became <i>adscripti glebæ</i>.
When the Irish fuidhir did the same his descendants
of the fourth generation found themselves not only
bound to the land, but also bound together by
something like the rules of the Cymric gwely, so that
one of them could not sell or charge his share without
the consent of the others. We found the same thing
in Norway, where the rules for payment of the
wergelds by relations were more elaborate than anywhere
else, and where the growth of kindred seems
so completely to have ruled the rise from one social
grade to another, till at last a man whose great-grandfather’s
great-grandfather was a freeborn landholder
became an odaller. If at first sight we were to
picture the odalman to ourselves as an individual
freeholder of Roman or modern type we should soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
find out our mistake when we learned that if he
wanted to sell his odal he must first <i>consult his odal-sharers</i>.
When examined closely the fact became
evident that it was the <i>group of kindred</i> that by long
settlement on the land had become odal, and that the
shares of individuals in the odal were subject&mdash;with,
of course, many differences&mdash;to some such tribal customs
as those of the Cymric gwely. The odalman
was thus not a single isolated landowner. He was
surrounded by kindred odal like himself, reciprocally
bound to fight for one another and swear for one
another, and to share in the payment or receipt of
one another’s wergeld. The odalman was protected
by his kindred, but his freedom of individual action
was restricted by it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Salic
alod a
family
holding.</div>

<p>So also under Salic law the joint inheritors of the
alod on <i>terra Salica</i>, with right of redivision between
great-grandchildren <i>per capita</i>, were in the same way
trammelled, and when by a solemn public form they
released themselves from their obligations to their
kindred they relinquished also all rights of inheritance
and protection (p. 134).</p>

<p>Are we to consider these Continental analogies to
be without relevance to Anglo-Saxon landholding?</p>

<p>Dr. Konrad von Maurer, in those masterly papers
contributed in 1855 to the ‘Kritische Ueberschau’
which are still so valuable, rightly lays stress upon
the power of the <i>kindred</i> as the great rival of the
power of the <i>state</i> in the development of Anglo-Saxon
polity. We find but little direct allusion to the
kindred in the laws, it is true. But incidentally and
as it were by accident we have learned from passages
mentioned in their proper place that so late as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
time of Athelstan there were kindreds both twelve-hynde
and twy-hynde powerful enough to defy the
King’s peace.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>This is in itself a significant reminder that more
or less of tribal custom remained in force behind the
screen of the laws from which most of our evidence
has been taken. And yet we seem to be almost
forced to the conclusion that if we try to realise the
position of the twelve-hynde settler we must regard
him, at all events for the first few generations, as in a
very different position from that of the Norse odalman
in the old country. Even though as head of his
family he may have brought descendants and
dependents with him, he could not in the new country
be at once surrounded by kinsmen and odal-sharers
who with himself had hereditary rights in the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anglo-Saxon
twelve-hynde
settler
pays gafol
and service
direct
to the
king.</div>

<p>We thus come round again to the point that
so far as he may have been separated from his
kindred the first Anglo-Saxon settler must have
found himself thrown upon the protection of his
chief and into a position of individual service.
He becomes, as we have seen according to the
scanty evidence of the Laws of Ine, a king’s gesith,
with military and judicial and administrative duties
to discharge, put into a post of service which he
cannot relinquish at pleasure. Service to the king
has to some extent taken the place of the restraints
of kindred, and so in a sense, like the twy-hynde man,
he has become a gafolgelda, but paying his gafol and
services direct to the king, and <i>adscriptus glebæ</i>,
but tied to an estate and an official position instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
of to a yardland.</p>

<p>This view of the position of the gesithcund and
twelve-hynde class rests very much upon the incidental
evidence of the Dooms of Ine, but the truth of
it is confirmed by the independent evidence of the
precious fragment already referred to. For its
interesting evidence shows that, in addition to his
holding of five hides of land, it was precisely into this
position of gafol-paying and service <i>direct to the king</i>
that the ceorl of ancient custom had to climb in order
to earn the gesithcund status and the twelve-hynde
wergeld.</p>

<p>Thus we arrive at a definite and practical mark
distinguishing ultimately, and perhaps more or less
from the first, the twelve-hynde and twy-hynde classes.</p>

<p>The twelve-hynde or landed class paid gafol and
did service direct to the king. The twy-hynde or
dependent class paid gafol and did service to the
landed class, who from this point of view were
middlemen between the twy-hynde gafolgelda and
the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The holding
direct
from the

becomes
a manor.</div>

<p>We seem, therefore, thus early to arrive at something
analogous to Professor Maitland’s technical
definition of the Manor as the fiscal unit from which
gafol is paid direct to the king, while its lord is the
receiver of the payments and services of its tenants.
The single landholder who is not under a manorial
lord in the Domesday survey is said to hold ‘as for
a manor’&mdash;though he may have no tenants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tribal

<p>It may be worth while in this connection to allude
to another general feature of the manorial estate on
both sides of the Channel which if not directly of
tribal origin must at least have worked in close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
sympathy with tribal custom.</p>

<p>The gesithcund man officially charged with the
control of a district or estate easily became in a
manorial sense lord of the dependent tenants upon
it. And the judicial and magisterial adjunct to the
lordship became a prevalent feature of the typical
manor.</p>

<p>We have seen that the ‘sac and soc’ of later
times may have grown from the root of the tribal
principle involved in the sacredness of the precinct
or area of protection of the chieftain and, in degree,
of every grade of tribesman who possessed a homestead.
How large a place this principle occupied is
shown by the prominence of the <i>fredus</i> in Frankish
law and of the <i>mundbyrd</i> in the early Anglo-Saxon
laws. The manor was a complex product of many
factors, and tribal custom was certainly one of
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was it a
family
holding?</div>

<p>Once again, what kind of a holding was that of
the twelve-hyndeman? Was it a family holding, and
what were the rules of succession?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Place
names in
favour of
its being
sometimes
a family
holding.</div>

<p>Unfortunately, we do not know how far the immigrants
came in kindreds and families or as followers
and ‘gesiths’ of military chieftains. But, in any
case, if we may take the evidence of place-names the
great number of patronymic names of places would
lead to the supposition that the holdings were family
holdings. The <i>ham</i> may at first have been the estate
of a gesithcund man held direct of the king with
gafolgeldas and geburs under him holding yardlands
and doing work on his demesne. But when it becomes
an <i>ingham</i> the patronymic termination points to the
lordship of the manor having been held, as time went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
on, jointly, in somewhat the same way as the Cymric
chieftainship in the gwely. His sons and grandsons
and great-grandsons may really have had their rights
of maintenance all along, and ultimately, if they were
allowed to do so, they may have sometimes divided
the inheritance instead of continuing to hold it
jointly. Tribal instincts working alone would probably
follow some such line as this.</p>

<p>But it is easy to see that the nearer the holding
of the twelve-hyndeman approached to a benefice or
office the stronger would be the tendency towards
single succession instead of divisions among heirs.</p>

<p>During the century or two after the first settlement
there was time, no doubt, for the growth of kindreds,
and the thane in the king’s service would soon become
the head of a family group; but, on the other hand,
many influences were at work undermining the solidarity
of the kindred and strengthening the manorial
element. Tribal instincts die hard. But probably
there never was full opportunity for the growth upon
English soil of anything like the solidarity in landholding
of the Norse kindreds of odal sharers tracing
back their family possession for four or five generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Folk-land
may have
devolved
under
tribal
custom.</div>

<p>There is but little evidence on the rights or rules
of succession to be found in the laws. And the
silence is suggestive of the continuance of custom.
Even the diplomatic evidence of wills and charters
is so much restricted to boc-land that it perhaps
throws a shadow rather than direct light upon the
ordinary devolution of land which had not become
the subject of the Romanised rules of ownership,
conveyance and testamentary disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>But if Professor Vinogradoff is right in his view
that folk-land was that land which was still held
under ancient custom, then for anything we know,
in spite of documentary silence, folk-land may still
have been held more or less as family rather than individual
property even in later times.</p>

<p>If the suggested analogy between the <i>terra Salica</i>
of the Salic laws and the <i>folk-land</i> of Anglo-Saxon
documents could be proved, the family character of
the holdings in both cases would receive confirmation.
At the same time the frequent concurrence of relatives
in Anglo-Saxon dispositions of land and the common
form of deprecation of future interference on their
part would at least be consistent with the supposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But
feudal
principles
would
tend towards
single
succession
outwardly.</div>

<p>That as time went on the growing force of feudal
principles would demand single succession to landed
estates whenever they could be regarded as benefices
is what might be expected. And it is worth noting
that under later feudal custom, by a kind of compromise,
what was really a family holding was often
artificially moulded for practical purposes into a
single holding with apparent single succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A single
holding
may cover
internal
family
divisions.</div>

<p>In the Domesday survey are many instances in
which thanes or soldiers here and there hold manors
or fractions of manors ‘pariter’ or ‘in paragio.’
And when the feudal tenancy ‘in parage’ is examined
in its fully developed form on the Continent, it is
found to present many resemblances to what under
Cymric custom the family holding of a tribal chief of
kindred might be if the chief alone were regarded as
the landed person doing homage to the superior lord
for all his kindred and if, in the next stage, when the
gwely was internally divided between brothers, one
of them only did homage for the rest. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
indeed in tribal custom as to the chieftainship and the
constitution of the gwely traits which easily allowed
themselves to be developed on feudal lines. For the
present purpose, however, the point seems to be that
within what looks from the outside like a single
individual landholding there may have been internal
family divisions which are not apparent.</p>

<p>Passing now from what may be regarded as the
holdings of the twelve-hynde class, more or less
tending to resemble manorial estates, to the yardlands
of the twy-hynde class, room may perhaps be found
even in their case for the exceptional continuance of
the family element in spite of the apparent single
succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kentish
family
holdings.</div>

<p>The Kentish holdings in sulungs and yokes instead
of in hides and yardlands seem to go back to the
earliest Kentish records. The fact that, in spite of
the difference in date between the evidence of the
earliest charters and that of the Domesday survey and
the surveys in the Battle Abbey records and the
‘Black Book of St. Augustine,’ the holdings seem to
have been throughout in sulungs and yokes points to
continuity. And when these sulungs and yokes in
the surveys are found to be very often held by ‘the
<i>heredes</i> of so and so,’ or ‘so and so and his <i>pares</i>,’ it
seems fair to suggest that in these Kentish holdings
there may have been a survival of family ownership.</p>

<p>Whether it were so or not, this later Kentish
evidence shows at least that the continuance of
family holdings was not necessarily inconsistent with
external uniformity in the sulungs and yokes of the
open-field system in Kent. And if so, why may not
the same thing be true in exceptional cases of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
hides and yardlands of Wessex and Mercia?</p>

<p>Contrary principles have a strange way in practice
of finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> till one of them at last overrides
the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gavelkind
holdings
were
family
holdings.</div>

<p>It will be remembered that one of the complaints
of the existence of kindreds powerful enough to defy
the king’s peace in King Athelstan’s time came from
Kent. And if these facts may be taken as evidence
that the solidarity of kindreds had been better preserved
in Kent than elsewhere some tribal light might
perhaps be thrown upon the survival of the custom
of gavelkind in Kent.</p>

<p>It is not a matter upon which we must dwell, but
evidently the gavelkind tenure must have been
something different from the prevalent tenures of
other districts. The difference cannot have been the
equal division of the sulungs and yokes between sons
as contrasted with the single succession to the yardlands
of other districts, because the sulungs and
yokes were apparently not interfered with by the
gavelkind division among heirs. And when the right
of the youngest son under the custom of gavelkind
to succeed to the parental hearth is compared with
the similar right of the youngest son in the case of
the Cymric gwely the inference becomes very strong
that the gavelkind holdings were family holdings and
the gavelkind divisions internal divisions within the
family, like those of the Cymric gwely, not necessarily
interfering with the permanence of the sulungs and
yokes of the open-field system of which the family
holdings were composed or in which the family had
rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p>The surveys of Kentish manors in the records of
Battle Abbey and the ‘Black Book of St. Augustine’
present instances sometimes of sulungs and yokes
held by the <i>heredes</i> of a deceased person and sometimes
of others which maintain their unity for
purposes of payments and services although in the
possession of several holders. The sulung in these
cases seems to have continued to be the unit liable
for the fixed ploughing and other services irrespective
of the question who were its occupants.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Once more perhaps some light may be gained
from Cymric tribal custom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analogy
of the
Cymric
trefgordd.</div>

<p>We have learned from the Cymric evidence that
a district might be divided for purposes of revenue
and food rents into sub-districts, irrespective of who
might be the occupants. And we have seen also how
the Cymric trefgordd or unit of pastoral occupation,
with its one plough and one churn and one herd
of cattle under a single herdsman, could remain a
permanent taxable unit paying the tunc pound in
lieu of food rents, whoever might at the time be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
its occupants and have cattle in the herd. Within
the lines of tribal custom itself the members of
a Cymric gwely might be spread over a district
and their cattle distributed among many trefgordds,
while from the chieftain’s point of view
the local units of taxation were uniform and
regular.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But the
yardlands
were
mostly
holdings
with single
succession
on payment
of a
relief to
the lord.</div>

<p>But this must not blind our eyes to the fact that
the yardlands on Anglo-Saxon estates were, so far as
we can see, for the most part really individual holdings
with actual single succession. However hard tribal
custom may have fought for the family element, the
manorial element in the end seems to have prevailed
on most manors so as to secure, for the purposes of the
lordship and the convenience of manorial management,
single succession to the yardlands. The fact
that as early as King Ine’s time we see new individual
holdings of geburs being made by the allotment of
yardlands and homesteads to individual tenants in
return for gafol and work, when taken in connection
with the ‘Rectitudines’ brings us back to the likeness
of these holdings to the holdings of the <i>villani</i> of
later times. We see in the allotment of stock to the
gebur, of which we trace scattered evidence, the fact
on which the principle of the later villenage was
based. Only when both homestead and yardland
came from the lord was there to be work as well
as gafol under King Ine’s laws. The stock of the
holding according to the ‘Rectitudines’ belonged in
theory to the lord and upon the tenant’s death
returned to the lord. The continuance to another
tenant on the payment of a relief involved the
admission that the holding and its outfit were a loan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
from the lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
manorial
element
must not
be lost
sight of.</div>

<p>The fact that in exceptional cases family holdings
were able to maintain their own under manorial
management must not be allowed to lead us to
underrate the power of the manorial element. There
were in tribal custom itself as described by Tacitus
elements of what we have elsewhere spoken of as the
embryo manor, but this must not blind our eyes to
the fact that something more was required to produce
the general uniformity of holdings and single succession
upon manorial estates than tribal custom working
alone.</p>

<p>If from a tribal point of view we try to understand
the growth of manorial serfdom and see how on the
Continent it was seemingly the result of the combination
of two leading factors, tribal custom and Roman
methods of land management, it becomes hardly
possible to ignore the presence of something like the
same combination of two interacting factors on British
or English ground.</p>

<p>With the manorial side of serfdom in its connection
with the widely prevalent open field system we
have already attempted to deal in a former volume.
That there may have been some continuity and
continuance of estates managed on the Roman system
can hardly be denied. However far the policy of
extermination of the old inhabitants was carried, it
never extended over the whole area. And the whole
of Britain was not conquered in the same century.
Even if the continuity of estates in Britain should be
considered to have been entirely broken by the Anglo-Saxon
invasions (which is hardly conceivable), it must
be admitted that continuity and likeness between England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
and the Continent as to land management was
very soon restored on monastic and other ecclesiastical
estates, and perhaps also upon what was Royal
domain. Nor can it be doubted that herein was a
force greatly strengthening the manorial element.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tribal
custom
only
would not
meet the
whole
case.</div>

<p>If we limit our view to the tribal side only of
the problem, we recognise that in Scandinavia and
in the Cymric districts of our own island and in
Ireland tribal principles working alone tended powerfully,
without help from the Roman side, to produce a
class of tenants becoming <i>adscripti glebæ</i> after four
generations of occupation, but it did not produce
either in Norway or in Wales or Ireland or in Celtic
Scotland that general and typical form of occupation in
uniform yardlands or ‘huben’ so prevalent in England
and Germany on manorial estates with ostensibly
single succession and services in so many points
resembling those of the Roman colonate.</p>

<p>Whether the manor was the indirect or direct
successor of the Roman Villa&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> whether the continuity
was broken or not&mdash;the <i>manorial</i> use of
the open-field system of agriculture seems to be
required to produce the uniformity of holdings
in yardlands and the single succession which marked
what is roughly called the serfdom of the manorial
estate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The open-field
system
not of
manorial
origin.</div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to repeat that the open-field
system itself was not of manorial origin. It was
essentially an economic result and differed very
greatly in its forms. Its main object seems to have
been fairness and equality of occupation. Under tribal
custom, in Wales, it arose out of coaration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
portions of the waste or pasture by the common
plough-team to which the tribesmen or the taeogs, as
the case might be, contributed oxen. The strips were
day-works of the plough taken in rotation by the
contributors according to the place of their oxen in
the plough-team for the season, and they returned
into common pasture when the crop had been
removed. The tribesman in the pastoral stage was
the owner of oxen but not of the strips ploughed by
them. They were merged again in the common
pasture of the district in which he had rights of
grazing for his cattle. And the cattle, and not the
corn crops, were the main thing upon which the system
turned.</p>

<p>Whatever method of distribution may have been
followed, as arable farming increased and the strips
became more and more permanently arable, mostly on
the two-field or the three-field system, the area of
unploughed land was more and more restricted and
the pasture over the stubbles and fallows obviously
became more and more essential. The cattle, on the
one hand, required the pasture on the stubbles and
fallows, and the land, before being ploughed again,
required the manure arising from the pasturing of
the flocks and herds upon it.</p>

<p>Where open-field husbandry still subsists in Western
Europe, whether on this or the other side of the
Channel, the owner of the strips has still no right of
grazing upon his own strips till upon the appointed
day when the common right begins of all the holders
to graze their cattle in a common herd or flock over
the whole area. This right is known in France as
the ‘vaine pâture,’ and it is still the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
and indestructible element in the open-field husbandry.
In the great open fields around Chartres a man
may plant his strips with vines if he likes, but to
this day, if he does so, he must let the sheep of the
commune graze over them after a certain date, in
exercise of the immemorial right of the <i>vaine pâture</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But uniform
holdings
and single
succession
are marks
of
manorial
lordship.</div>

<p>In all this no manorial element need be present,
and when the manorial element is absent there is not
necessarily any uniformity or single succession in the
holdings. But when manorial management comes
upon the top of this widely extended and all but
universal system of agriculture, whether in Roman
times or later, the bundle of scattered strips which
under tribal custom could be ploughed by a pair of
oxen whether alone or in joint ploughing is very naturally
taken as the typical holding. And thus when we
find in the Laws of Ine and later records gafolgeldas
and geburs settled upon yardlands and doing service
by week-work on the lord’s demesne the natural
inference must be that it is the result of manorial
land management and that there has come into existence
already something like a manor with something
like a community in serfdom upon it, using the
prevalent open-field system as the shell in which it
will henceforth live so far as its agriculture is concerned.</p>

<p>And so it seems natural to attribute to the manorial
management and the manorial requirement of
fixed services and dues the uniformity of the holdings
and the single succession by which the uniformity
was preserved. The power which seeks and makes
uniformity seems to come from above. Agricultural
communities of free tribesmen who had become individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
freeholders (if such could be conceived of as
prevalent in King Ine’s and King Alfred’s time) would
probably have used the open-field system in a quite
different way. And we see no trace of it in the
evidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later evidence
of
free holdings
may
not be to
the point.</div>

<p>When, however, we have said this we have no
disposition to ignore or make light of the later evidence
upon which great stress has quite rightly been
laid by Professor Maitland in his remarkable work
on ‘The Domesday Survey and beyond,’ showing
that there were in some districts villages, in which the
manorial element was apparently absent in the time
of Edward the Confessor, though appearing as manors
after the Conquest. He has suggested that in these
villages not only the manor in name but also the
manor as a thing was apparently non-existent. There
was in these cases apparently, in King Edward’s time,
no demesne land upon which the services of a tenantry
in villenage could be rendered, and the tenants
were often sokemen who had individually put themselves
under the protection of this lord or that, instead
of there being one lordship over the group, as in a
manor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Danish
wars left
many
estates
vacant,
which
may have
been reconstructed
on
feudal
rather
than
manorial
lines.</div>

<p>These lordless villages on the eve of the Conquest
as shown by the entries T. R. E. in the Domesday
survey and especially in the ‘Inquisitio Eliensis,’
merit more careful study than has yet been given to
them, and so far as they can be shown to prove
the existence of free villages of <i>liberi homines</i> or
<i>socmanni</i>, after the Conquest merged sometimes in
the class of <i>villani</i>, I am ready to welcome the
evidence. But unless they can be traced back to
earlier times, their occurrence mostly in the Danish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
districts interspersed with other villages which were
manors and had demesne land, together with the
singular fact that the holders in these villages were
commended to several lords, suggests that their
peculiar position may date from the time of the
Danish invasions, and be the result of the devastations
as to the effects of which the ‘Liber Eliensis’
contains so much evidence. Many a manor may
have lost both lord and tenants, and have been filled
up again by the great lords of the district with new
tenants&mdash;soldiers and servants who had served in the
wars, it may be. Thus these cases, in which many
features of the ordinary manor were apparently
missing in the time of Edward the Confessor, may be
of recent date and so, while important when viewed
in relation to the Domesday survey and the changes
made by the Conquest, not specially instructive as
regards earlier Anglo-Saxon conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fact
regarding
the
Danelaga
still very
little
known.</div>

<p>Unfortunately, as we have seen, the laws of the
Danish period, while recording existing and modified
Anglo-Saxon customs on various points, leave us in the
dark as to Danish custom, whether of old standing in
the Danelaga or newly imported in King Cnut’s time.
It was, no doubt, known to the invaders, and it was
enough for them to say ‘as the law stands,’ though we
do not know what it was. The whole question of the
Danelaga was purposely omitted from the scope of
my former volume, and now, after twenty years, still
remains a subject requiring careful examination by
future inquirers.</p>

<p>But this cannot be done completely until the
minute work which Professor Maitland and Mr. Round
and Mr. Corbett are gradually doing upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
Domesday survey itself in its local details has been
further pursued, and it lies, with so many other
branches of a difficult subject, beyond the limits of
the inquiry made in this volume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New
feudal
tenures
may have
had a
tribal
root. St.

successive
lives.</div>

<p>Reference may, however, be incidentally made to
the numerous cases in which, in order to describe the
nature of the tenure of socmanni and others under
what were perhaps new conditions, the fact was
recorded in varying phrases whether this person or
that could or could not leave or sell his land. Of
some it is stated ‘possunt recedere,’ of others ‘non
possunt recedere’&mdash;of some ‘possunt vendere,’ of
others ‘non possunt vendere.’ Though these tenures
may have been comparatively modern and may belong
to a period of advanced feudal conditions, still it may
be possible that some trait of tribal custom may lurk
at the root of the distinction. From the manorial
point of view, it was necessary to record of the socmanni
whether they had only limited rights in the land subject
to the performance of services and ‘consuetudines’
(which, by the way, seem to have been very much like
those of the villani) or whether they were permanent
freeholders who could sell their holdings and leave the
land when they liked.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The position of the tenants
in this respect was probably dependent upon the
tenure under which they held, <i>i.e.</i> upon whether they
were tenants with only life interests, or for successive
lives, or, as we should say, tenants in fee. After the
devastations of war many new tenants must have
been put upon desolated manors, and Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
Maitland has very rightly laid stress in another connection
on the traditional habit of granting leases for
three lives only, so that a holding might ultimately
return to the lord. He has pointed out that when
Bishop Oswald (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 962-992), exercising manorial
rights over the great domain of the Church of Worcester
made these leases to thanes on certain services
for three successive lives (<i>i.e.</i> for the lives of father,
son, and grandson) he did it expressly for the purpose
of securing to his successor full power to renew them
or not.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> And from a tribal point of view it may be
a pertinent question whether the restriction to the
three generations had not some indirect connection
with the tribal custom or instinct, so often alluded to,
which gave to the fourth generation of uninterrupted
occupation fixity of tenure and status.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tribal
custom
known to
Danes and
Normans.</div>

<p>Recurring to the scattered cases of thanes holding
‘in paragio’ and by no means confined to the Danish
districts,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> it was necessary to state in the Domesday
records, as in the case of the socmanni, whether
they had or had not power to leave or to sell, and
it may be useful that we should be reminded by
these cases, in which feudal custom had possibly
arisen out of tribal custom, that tribal custom was
not unknown to the Danish and Norman conquerors
of England. The Danish immigrants came from
a district in which tribal custom was still fresh
and vigorous. The Normans too, as is shown by the
so-called Laws of Henry I., found Anglo-Saxon
custom by no means altogether alien to their own
instincts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>

<p>Before concluding this essay perhaps a further
observation should be made.</p>

<p>We have learned in the course of this inquiry
that it does not do to take too insular a view of
Anglo-Saxon conditions. The similarity of wergelds,
and indeed of tribal custom generally, has throughout
become very apparent. But perhaps it is hardly
more striking than the similarity in the <i>modifications</i>
of tribal custom found in the laws on both sides
of the Channel.</p>

<p>In their migrations and conquests the conquering
tribes found themselves everywhere breathing a
moral atmosphere in which it was difficult for the
old tribal instincts to live. In such matters as the
responsibility of a master for his slave’s homicides
and of relatives for their kinsman’s crimes we have
watched as it were modifications of tribal custom in
the course of being made, here and there, on almost
identical lines. May it not have been so also in
regard to the important matter of the division of
classes?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Romanising
and
Christian
influences
apart
from the
manor.</div>

<p>If we have recognised rightly the tribal principles
originally at the root of the distinction between the
twelve-hynde and twy-hynde classes there is no
reason why we should not recognise also that besides
the potent force of manorial management there may
have been other influences at work widening the
gulf between the two classes, and, so to speak,
reducing to a level the members of each class by
breaking away the rungs of the ladder between them.</p>

<p>It must not be overlooked that in the earliest
Continental laws most nearly contemporary with those
of Kent&mdash;Alamannic, Bavarian, Burgundian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
Wisigothic&mdash;the divisions of society have a very
artificial look, as though largely based upon wealth
rather than the tribal principles of kindred.</p>

<p>Now, German writers are not agreed upon the
point whether these artificial divisions found in these
earliest of the laws ought to be regarded as belonging
to ancient German custom or whether they may
not rather be traced to Roman influences.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
earliest
laws most
influenced
by Roman
traditions.</div>

<p>We have already seen how necessary it is in connection
with these early laws to discriminate between
ancient custom and the new influences which were
working in them in the direction of individualism and
the disintegration of the kindred. The earliest laws
are, as we have seen, just those in which tribal custom
had fared the worst.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Non-tribal
division of
classes.</div>

<p>In the Alamannic Pactus of the sixth century
(Fragment ii. 36) the grades for wergelds were as
under:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) ‘baro de minoflidis,’</p>

<p>(2) ‘medianus Alamannus,’</p>

<p>(3) ‘primus’ <i>or</i> ‘meliorissimus Alamannus.’</p>

</div>

<p>And these were subdivisions of the <i>ingenuus</i> class, for
there were below them the <i>lidus</i> and the <i>servus</i>. In
another clause (iii. s. 25) a similar division is applied
to animals. The penalties are given for killing
ordinary, ‘mediana,’ and ‘meliorissima jumenta.’</p>

<p>In the Burgundian law the division of society into
three grades&mdash;<i>optimates</i>, <i>mediocres</i>, and <i>inferiores</i>&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
found in the <i>Lex Romana</i> and is applied to Romans
and Burgundians alike. These divisions seem to
supplant those of kindred, and to have no tribal
principle at their root.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>In the Wisigothic laws the disintegration of tribal
society is so far advanced that the wergelds of the
<i>ingenuus</i> class are regulated, not by kindred or social
position, but, as we have seen, according to the age
of the individual.</p>

<p>It is difficult not to connect the substitution of
artificial grades for those dependent on kindred with
the Roman tendency to divide society into ‘patrician’
and ‘plebs,’ and the ‘plebs’ according to position and
wealth into <i>honestiores</i> and <i>humiliores</i>.</p>

<p>Already in Cæsar’s time we see how difficult it
was from a Roman point of view to understand the
relation under tribal custom of the dependent tribesmen
to their chieftain. Cæsar does not seem to have
recognised the link of blood-relationship between
them. To his view the chieftains were <i>equites</i> and
the tribesmen almost their <i>servi</i>. It was difficult
otherwise to bring the two classes within some
recognised category of Roman law.</p>

<p>So it was no doubt, in degree, at the later period
in the case of the conquering German tribes, when
the Romanising forces were mainly in clerical hands.</p>

<p>The influence of the Church also told in favour
of the artificial and anti-tribal division of the people
into great men and small men. Its tenets of individual
responsibility favoured individualism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The anti-tribal
influences
of
the
Church
in Southern
Europe.</div>

<p>Canon XVI. of the Council of Orleans (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 549)
shows that the ecclesiastical mind in Gaul was familiar
with the division into classes ‘majorum et mediocrium
personarum.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of Merovingian
formulæ
as regards
wergelds.</div>

<p>A canon of an earlier Council (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 511) shows how
by taking refuge in a church a homicide received
protection till composition was arranged, and how
thus the question of wergelds was brought within
clerical recognition. Once brought within its power
the Church was not likely to let it slip from its
grasp. And the collections of Formulæ of the
Merovingian period show how the clergy joined with
the other authorities in arranging the payment of
wergelds and the prevention of private vengeance.
From these formulæ it would seem that the payment
and perhaps the amount of the wergeld had become
to some extent a matter of mediation and arrangement
through the intervention of ‘boni homines’ who were
sometimes ‘sacerdotes.’<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> And when the award was
given and the payment made, it was natural that a
formal charter of acknowledgment in stay of
vengeance on the part of the relations of the slain
should be insisted upon. Each set of formulæ
contains a form for this purpose. The matter of wergelds
had become a subject of Franco-Roman conveyancing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clerical
influences
in England
in
favour of
individualism,
evident
in the
modification
of
custom
found in
the
Anglo-Saxon
laws.</div>

<p>Romanising and clerical influences thus working
together in connection with wergelds would naturally
tend to exclude from consideration the question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
kindred, and to make the payment of the wergeld a
matter for the homicide alone.</p>

<p>Long before the time of King Ine these Romanising
influences must have been at work in England, as
elsewhere, introducing new considerations of justice
and the position of classes founded on Roman law
and Christian feeling, and not upon tribal custom.</p>

<p>We have recognised some such action as this in
the nearly contemporary Canons and in the Kentish
laws, as well as in the later Anglo-Saxon laws, and
indeed again and again throughout this inquiry, so
that while we have had to notice again and again
the extent to which the Church succumbed to tribal
custom when it suited its purpose to do so, it must
not be forgotten how much of the modification of
custom found in the laws was due to the influence of
the Romanised Church.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, enough to recognise only
Romanised forms of land management under clerical
influence. We must recognise also something of the
same persistent antagonism of the Church to tribal
custom which on the Continent had already in the
sixth and seventh centuries sometimes succeeded in
extruding considerations of kindred from the matter
of wergelds, and to a great extent also from the
question of the division of classes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Last
words.</div>

<p>With this further recognition of outside influences,
this contribution towards the understanding of a
difficult question must come to an end. All that
can be claimed on its behalf is that a few further
steps in advance may have been made good. It may
seem to have resulted rather in the restatement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
some of the problems than in their solution. But
this is what might be expected from the attempt to
approach a subject which has many sides especially
with light from the tribal side only. Following the
true method of working from the known to the
unknown, it is not until such a problem has been
approached separately from its different sides that a
final solution can be reached; and this involves the
fellow work of many historical students.</p>

<p>In the meantime, without ignoring or seeking to
minimise the force of other important influences, it
may, I think, safely be said that we have found
the influence of tribal custom upon Anglo-Saxon
polity and economic conditions as apparent, all
things considered, as there could be reason to expect.</p>

<p>It was a factor in economic development which,
among others and in due proportion, has to be
reckoned with, and its study has the special value
that it helps to bring the student of the Anglo-Saxon
laws to regard them from the point of view of the
Anglo-Saxon settlers themselves.</p>

<i>da</i> in Carnarvonshire local dialect
still means ‘cattle,’ while in other
parts of Wales it has the wider
meaning of ‘goods.’</p>

<p>The allotment of cattle involved
grazing rights, and often
separate homesteads. Accordingly
in the Denbigh Extent we find
that so and so ‘habet domum’
or ‘non habet domum.’</p>

<p>This dependence for maintenance
of the boy upon the
higher chieftain is indirectly confirmed
by the Extents, which
mention among the chieftain’s
rights the ‘fosterage of youths’
&amp;c. See <i>Tribal System in Wales</i>,
p. 169.</p>

<p>That the chieftain who gives
the <i>da</i> was the ‘chief of kindred’
and not a mere territorial lord is
shown by the fact that when a
stranger family have lived in the
land till they have formed a
kindred by intermarriage with
Cymraes, all the members of the
family become ‘man and kin’ to
the chief of kindred of the new
kindred. <i>Tribal System in Wales</i>,

<p><a name="Footnote_67" id="Footnote_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> The view here taken, that
the four fines in the geilfine division
are classes or grades of
relationship, makes more intelligible
the rules laid down in the
Book of Aicill (iii. 331-335), especially
the one which determines
that ‘if one person comes up into
the “geilfine” so as to make it
excessive, a man must go out of
it into the “deirbhfine,” and a
man is to pass from one division
into the other up as far as the
indfine, and a man is to pass
from that into the community.’
Obviously, as a fresh <i>generation</i>
comes into the nearest hearth, a
generation at the top naturally
moves out of the group. The
great-grandfather becomes a great-great-grandfather,
and so on.</p>

cannot have been the result of
ignorance of the Roman standard.
We learn from the excellent table
given by Montelius in his <i>Remains
from the Iron Age of
Scandinavia</i> that the gold solidi
of the Eastern Empire found
their way into the Islands of Gotland,
Oland, and Bornholm in
considerable numbers, between
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 395 and 518. He shows that,
while no silver coins of the Republic
or before Nero have been
found in Scandinavia, coins belonging
to the silver currency
of Rome after Nero found their
way northwards in considerable
numbers. Of Roman coins <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
98-192 only four gold coins are
known to have been found and
2304 silver coins. Then the gold
currency begins, and of dates
between <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 235-395, sixty-four
gold coins have been found and only
one solitary silver coin. Lastly
came the gold currency of the
solidus of Constantine and his
successors <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 395-518, and of
this period 286 gold coins and one
silver coin are recorded as having
been found in Scandinavia. It is
clear, then, that the Roman standard
as well as the Roman system
of division of the lb. was known
in the North. For a long period
no doubt the chief trade of the
Baltic was with the Byzantine
Empire and the East.</p>

English penny of 32 wheat-grains
was 1·51 grammes. The coins of
Cnut’s predecessors sometimes
fully reached this standard, though
oftener somewhat below it. The
exact weight of 1/20 of the Danish
ore would be 1·21 grammes, and
Cnut’s silver pence seem to aim at
this weight. Out of 574 silver pence
of Cnut described in the Catalogue
of the British Museum 400 weigh
between ·972 and 1·23 grammes.
Only 1½ per cent. are of greater
weight. Ethelred’s silver pence
were not by any means generally
of full standard of 32 wheat-grains
or 1·51 grammes, but still,
out of 339 in the British Museum
25 per cent. are fairly up to this
standard and 90 per cent. are
above the weight of the new
silver pence of Cnut&mdash;1/20 of his
ore. Cnut also reduced the <i>size</i> of
the pence. See the B. M. Catalogue

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_257" id="Footnote_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> The usual explanation of
these terms is that they are derived
from the number of shillings
in the wergeld. Mr. Earle
in his valuable <i>Handbook to the
Land Charters</i> &amp;c. (p. 1) considers
‘hynde’ to be an old form
of ‘ten’ and to refer to the number
of soldiers of whom the twelve-hynde
and six-hynde men were
captains. ‘The former was a
captain of 120 and the latter of
60.’ Neither of these explanations
seems to me to be satisfactory.</p>

oath of the twelve-hyndeman was
reckoned as a 10 hide oath is
confirmed by the translation in
the Latin of the <i>Quadripartitus</i>
of Ine’s Laws, s. 46. The Anglo-Saxon
‘þonne sceal he be lx hyda
onsacan,’ is translated by ‘tunc
debet per lx hidas <i>i.e.</i> <i>per vi
homines</i> abnegare.’ And in s. 19
‘potest jurare pro lx hidis <i>i.e.</i> <i>pro
hominibus vi</i>.’ Schmid remarks
on these passages: ‘Hiernach

and Mark xii. 15, ‘Show me a
penny,’ the word used to translate
‘denarius’ is <i>skatt</i>.</p>

<p>Again, Luke vii. 41, the two
debtors, one owing 500 and the
other 50 denarii, are translated by
Ulphilas as owing ‘skatte finfhunda’
and ‘skatte finftiguns.’</p>

<p>Again in John xii. 5, ‘Why
was not the ointment sold for 300
denarii?’ ‘ccc skatti’ are the
words used, and so also in the
parallel passage Mark xi. 5,
‘thrijahunda skatti.’</p>

<p>In all these cases it seems to
be clear that the <i>skatt</i> is the <i>coin</i>.
And that it was a silver coin seems
to be shown by the use by Ulphilas
of the word <i>skatt</i> in reference to
the ‘thirty pieces of silver’ in
Matt. xxvii. 6-9.</p>

‘Geldrechnung,’ p. 594. The inference
seems to be too strong to
be disregarded. Comparing s. 54
with ss. 70-72, the great toe is
valued at 10 scillings, <i>i.e.</i> half the
value of the thumb in s. 54, viz.
20 scillings. And it is stated in
s. 54 that the thumb nail is worth
3 scillings, and in s. 72 that the
toe nail is to be paid for at 30
scætts, which would be half 3 scillings
of 20 sceatts. The other
toes are said in s. 71 to be respectively
worth half the fingers.
The finger nail in s. 71 at 1 scilling
compares with the other toe
nails at 10 scætts in s. 72&mdash;again
one half. Presuming that the
scale of one half is maintained
throughout, 30 scætts is half 3
scillings and 10 scætts half one
scilling. The scilling, therefore,
must be 20 scætts.</p>

<p>This conclusion is strengthened
by the graduated scale of
payments in ss. 33-36, viz. 50
scætts (<i>i.e.</i> 1½ scilling) 3, 4, 10,
20 scillings. See also s. 16, where
the scale is 30, 50 (? 60) sceatts
and 6 scillings (120 scætts). In
ss. 58-60 a bruise is 1 scilling,
covered 30 scætts, uncovered 20
scætts. It seems to be impossible
to make these figures comport
with the Mercian scilling of 4
scætts or the Wessex of 5 scætts
or the Salic solidus of 40 scætts.
The conclusion must be that the
Kentish scilling was of 20 scætts.</p>

holdings, but reference may be
made by way of example to the
5½ ‘sulings’ of ‘Christelet’ in the

The suling is still the unit for
services and payments. The
‘<i>Suling de Fayreport</i>’ contains
300 acres (and was probably
originally a suling and a half),
but it is divided into 11 holdings,
8 of 25 acres each and 3 of
33⅓ acres each. Six of the eleven
holdings are still occupied by
persons bearing the name of
‘de Fayreport’ or the ‘heredes’
of such persons, and probably the
others may belong to relatives.
The ‘<i>Suling de Ores</i>’ is, on the
other hand, divided into about
40 quite irregular holdings, varying
from less than an acre to
44 acres. Several are still
occupied by ‘heredes’ of persons
of the family ‘de Ores.’ (Cottonian
MSS. Faustina, A. 1, British

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
